This method combines some of the advantages of the volume-of-fluid method with the level set method to obtain a method which is generally superior to either method alone. We present direct comparisons between computations made with the \{CLSVOF\} method and computations made with the level set method, the volume-of-fluid method, and the boundary integral method. We also compare our computations to the exact solution for an oscillating ellipse due to Lamb and experimental results obtained for a rising gas bubble in liquid obtained by Hnat and Buckmaster. Our computational examples focus on flows in which surface tension forces and changes in topology are dominant features of the flow. },

We find that when the interface is smooth (e.g., continuous with two continuous derivatives) the new methods are second-order accurate and the other algorithms are first-order accurate. We propose a design criteria for a volume-of-fluid interface reconstruction algorithm to be second-order accurate. Namely, that it reproduce lines in two space dimensions or planes in three space dimensions exactly. We also introduce a second-order, unsplit, volume-of-fluid advection algorithm that is based on a second-order, finite difference method for scalar conservation laws due to Bell, Dawson and Shubin. We test this advection algorithm by modeling several different interface shapes propagating in two simple incompressible flows and compare the results with the standard second-order, operator-split advection algorithm. Although both methods are second-order accurate when the interface is smooth, we find that the unsplit algorithm exhibits noticeably better resolution in regions where the interface has discontinuous derivatives, such as at corners.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the Enhanced-Discretization Interface-Capturing Technique (EDICT) for computation of unsteady flow problems with interfaces, such as two-fluid and free-surface flows. In EDICT, we solve, over a non-moving mesh, the Navier-Stokes equations together with an advection equation governing the evolution of an interface function with two distinct values identifying the two fluids. The starting point for the spatial discretization of these equations are the stabilized finite element formulations which possess good stability and accuracy properties. To increase the accuracy in modeling the interfaces, we use finite element functions corresponding to enhanced discretization at and near the interface. These functions are designed to have multiple components, with each component coming from a different level of mesh refinement over the same computational domain. The primary component of the functions for velocity and pressure comes from the base mesh called Mesh-1. A subset of the elements in Mesh-1 are identified to be at or near the interface, and depending on where the interface is, this subset could change from one time level to another. A Mesh-2 is constructed by patching together the second-level meshes generated over this subset of elements, and the second component of the functions for velocity and pressure comes from Mesh-2. For the interface function, we have a third component coming from a Mesh-3 which is constructed by patching together the third-level meshes generated over a subset of elements in Mesh-2. With parallel computation of the test problems presented here, we demonstrate that the \{EDICT\} can be used very effectively to increase the accuracy of the base finite element formulations.},

In the deforming-spatial-domain/space-time (DSD/ST) procedure the variational formulation of a problem is written over its space-time domain, and therefore the deformation of the spatial domain with respect to time is taken into account automatically. Because the space-time mesh is generated over the space-time domain of the problem, within each time step, the boundary (or interface) nodes move with the boundary (or interface). Whether the motion of the boundary is specified or not, the strategy is nearly the same. If the motion of the boundary is unknown, then the boundary nodes move as defined by the other unknowns at the boundary (such as the velocity or the displacement). At the end of each time step a new spatial mesh covers the new spatial domain. For computational feasibility, the finite element interpolation functions are chosen to be discontinuous in time, and the fully discretized equations are solved one space-time slab at a time.},

In the DSD/ST approach, the stabilized variational formulations for these types of flow problem are written over their space-time domains. One of the important features of the approach is that it enables one to circumvent the difficulty involved in remeshing every time step and thus reduces the projection errors introduced by such frequent remeshings. Computations are performed for various test problems mainly for the purpose of demonstrating the computational capability developed for this class of problems. In some of the test cases, such as the liquid drop problem, surface tension is taken into account.

The interface-capturing techniques, developed primarily for free-surface and two-fluid interface flows, are formulated typically over non-moving meshes, using an advection equation in addition to the flow equations. The advection equation governs the evolution of an interface function that marks the location of the interface.

  Abstract                 = {We present the 3D implementation and applications of the enhanced-discretization interface-capturing technique (EDICT) in computation of unsteady flows with two-fluid interfaces. In such computations, \{EDICT\} can be used as a very effective method, which combines the flexibility and efficiency of interface-capturing techniques with the accuracy provided by enhanced discretization at the interfaces. A stabilized finite element interface-capturing technique is used as the base formulation to solve, over a typically non-moving mesh, the Navier–Stokes equations and an advection equation governing the interface function. To increase the accuracy in modeling the interfaces, we use finite element functions with multiple components at and near the interfaces, with each component coming from a different level of mesh refinement. With its parallel implementation on advanced high-performance computing platforms such as the \{CRAY\} T3E, \{EDICT\} is a powerful tool for the simulation of a complex, 3D unsteady flow problems with two fluid-interfaces, including free surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {The enhanced-discretization space–time technique (EDSTT) was developed for the purpose of being able to, in the context of a space–time formulation, enhance the time-discretization in regions of the fluid domain requiring smaller time steps. Such requirements are often encountered in time-accurate computations of fluid–structure interactions, where the time-step size required by the structural dynamics part is smaller, and carrying out the entire computation with that time-step size would be too inefficient for the fluid dynamics part. In the EDSTT-single-mesh (EDSTT-SM) approach, a single space–time mesh, unstructured both in space and time, would be used to enhance the time-discretization in regions requiring smaller time steps. In the EDSTT-multi-mesh (EDSTT-MM) approach, we complement the space–time concept of the deforming-spatial-domain/stabilized space–time (DSD/SST) formulation with the multi-mesh concept of the enhanced-discretization interface-capturing technique (EDICT). In applications to fluid–structure interactions, the structural dynamics modeling is based on a single space–time mesh and the fluid dynamics modeling is based on two space–time meshes. The structural dynamics interface nodes in the space–time domain also belong to the second fluid mesh, which accommodates the time-step requirement of the structural dynamics. We apply the EDSTT-SM and EDSTT-MM approaches to a number of test problems to demonstrate how these methods work and why they would be desirable to use in time-accurate computations. },

  Abstract                 = {A numerical method for solving three-dimensional free surface flows is presented. The technique is an extension of the GENSMAC code for calculating free surface flows in two dimensions. As in GENSMAC, the full Navier–Stokes equations are solved by a finite difference method; the fluid surface is represented by a piecewise linear surface composed of quadrilaterals and triangles containing marker particles on their vertices; the stress conditions on the free surface are accurately imposed; the conjugate gradient method is employed for solving the discrete Poisson equation arising from a velocity update; and an automatic time step routine is used for calculating the time step at every cycle. A program implementing these features has been interfaced with a solid modelling routine defining the flow domain. A user-friendly input data file is employed to allow almost any arbitrary three-dimensional shape to be described. The visualization of the results is performed using computer graphic structures such as phong shade, flat and parallel surfaces. Results demonstrating the applicability of this new technique for solving complex free surface flows, such as cavity filling and jet buckling, are presented.

  Abstract                 = {This paper is aimed at developing a robust algorithm (FBICS) to capture the interface between two immiscible fluids without the need of interface reconstruction. The advection equation of the volume fraction is solved using the fully conservative finite volume method. Determination of the convective flux through each cell face is based on blending of high resolution schemes and compressive schemes to preserve the sharpness and boundedness of the interface. The flux-blending practice is fulfilled with the use of flux limiters. Test on simple advection flow problems indicates that the well-known \{CICSAM\} and \{HRIC\} schemes lose accuracy as the Courant number increases. In contrast, the present method maintains high-accuracy performance for Courant numbers up to one. The capability of the method to cope with the complicated dynamics of free surface flows is demonstrated via calculation of the collapsing flow of a water column with an obstacle. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this work we present a new method for tracking evolving interfaces. Like the Adaptive Oriented Particle Level Set method (AOPLS, Ianniello and Mascio, 2010), it uses a combination of unconnected particles containing geometric information and a level set function to track the interface. In the present method, the geometric information, solved for in each particle, is a set of tangent vectors and the corresponding curvature tensor of the interface. Compared to the \{AOPLS\} method, the amount of geometric data stored in each particle is roughly halved, while still retaining a description of the interface that includes both orientation and curvature. A mechanism for ensuring a sufficiently dense distribution of particles on the interface is also included. From the information stored in each particle, a “continuous” representation of the interface is obtained by transferring the information to a level set function stored on an Eulerian grid. Unlike the \{AOPLS\} method, the present method takes the curvature into account when the zero level set is constructed. This results in significant improvements in regions of high curvature. Two different formulations of the new method have been explored. In the first, the tangent vectors deform purely according to the velocity field. In the second, the tangent vectors are forced to coincide with the principal directions of the surface. Both formulations are shown to be applicable. },

  Abstract                 = {Fluidâ€“structure interaction (FSI) problems are of great relevance to many fields in engineering and applied sciences. One wide spread and complex FSI-subclass is the category that studies the instationary behavior of incompressible viscous flows and thin-walled structures exhibiting large deformations. Free surfaces often present an essential additional challenge for this class of problems. Prominent application areas are fluid sloshing in tanks and numerable problems in offshore engineering and naval architecture. Especially when partitioned strong coupling schemes are used in order to solve the coupled \{FSI\} problem the design of an appropriate overall computational approach including free surface effects is not trivial. In this paper a new so-called partitioned implicit free surface approach is introduced and embedded into a strong coupling \{FSI\} solver. For complex problem classes this approach is combined with the general elevation equation that is closed through a dimensionally reduced pseudo-structural approach. The presented approach shows the same stability properties as a full implicit approach but is by far more efficientâ€”especially in the partitioned coupled case. },

  Abstract                 = {We have successfully extended our implicit hybrid finite element/volume (FE/FV) solver to flows involving two immiscible fluids. The solver is based on the segregated pressure correction or projection method on staggered unstructured hybrid meshes. An intermediate velocity field is first obtained by solving the momentum equations with the matrix-free implicit cell-centered FV method. The pressure Poisson equation is solved by the node-based Galerkin FE method for an auxiliary variable. The auxiliary variable is used to update the velocity field and the pressure field. The pressure field is carefully updated by taking into account the velocity divergence field. This updating strategy can be rigorously proven to be able to eliminate the unphysical pressure boundary layer and is crucial for the correct temporal convergence rate. Our current staggered-mesh scheme is distinct from other conventional ones in that we store the velocity components at cell centers and the auxiliary variable at vertices. The fluid interface is captured by solving an advection equation for the volume fraction of one of the fluids. The same matrix-free FV method, as the one used for momentum equations, is used to solve the advection equation. We will focus on the interface sharpening strategy to minimize the smearing of the interface over time. We have developed and implemented a global mass conservation algorithm that enforces the conservation of the mass for each fluid. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, a connectivity-free front tracking method is developed to simulate multiphase flows with free surfaces. This method is based on the point-set method which does not require any connectivities between interfacial points to represent the interface. The main advantage of the connectivity-free approach is the easiness in re-constructing the interface when large topology change occurs. It requires an indicator field to be constructed first based on the existing interface and the surface curvature and normal are then computed using the indicator field. Here, we adopt the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) interpolation function that provides the ability to deal with free-surface flows and the flexibility of using non-uniform meshes when local fine resolution is needed. A points regeneration scheme is developed to construct smooth interfaces and to automatically handle topology changes. The mass conservation is verified by performing a single vortex advection test. Several 2-D and 3-D numerical tests including an oscillating droplet, dam-breaking, two droplet impacting and multi-bubble merging are presented to show the accuracy and the robustness of the method. },

In light of the \{ALE\} description, the moving free surface is accurately tracked in a self-adaptive manner by introduction of the moving least square (MLS) surface fitting method to fully determine the movement of the nodes on the moving free surface, meanwhile the mesh distortions are effectively alleviated. By virtue of the \{ALE\} method, a local remeshing strategy is developed for the mesh regeneration frequently required in moving free surface flow problems, so that the interpolation errors due to the mesh regeneration process are minimized and occur only limited to some local regions, and the computational cost for the remeshing process is reduced decisively. The numerical examples of three dimensional injection molding flows are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed numerical scheme. },

We combine the \{HLSVC\} interface advection algorithm with a two phase flow solver in order to numerically capture deforming bubbles and drops whose actual volume (s) fluctuate about fixed “target” volume (s). Three novel developments are described: (1) a new method for enforcing a volume constraint in which the number of bubbles and drops can change due to merging or splitting, (2) a new, second order, semi-lagrangian narrow band level set reinitialization algorithm, and (3) validation of a two-phase flow numerical method by comparison with linear stability analysis results for a co-flowing liquid jet in gas. The new interface capturing method is tested on benchmark problems in which the velocity is prescribed (passive advection of interfaces) and in which the velocity is determined by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for two-phase flow. The error in interface position when using the hybrid level set-volume constraint method is reported for many benchmark problems in polar coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, and on an adaptive grid in which one criteria of adaptivity is the magnitude of the interface curvature. },

  Abstract                 = {An unsteady single-phase level set RANS method is used to resolve and investigate bow wave breaking around a surface combatant advancing in calm water, including induced vortices and free surface scars. A level set free surface capturing approach was extended and combined with local overset grid refinement for resolution of complex interfacial topologies and small-scale free surface features. Although the focus of the paper is on wave breaking at Fr=0.35, results over three speeds (Fr=0.28, 0.35, and 0.41) show that the method can accurately predict the changes in resistance and free surface topology, with the two highest speeds showing bow wave breaking. For the Fr=0.35 case, comparison of wave elevation results shows good agreement with the data, including the development and thickening of the bow wave sheet, sequential formation of two overturning plungers with reconnections, and the formation of two free surface scars at the reconnection sites. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solution shows a steep shoulder wave, similar to the experiment, but does not predict the experimentally observed weak spilling breaking shoulder wave. Although the current predictions converge to steady state, the region of unsteady free surface measured experimentally can be reasonably well predicted from the region of the simulation where the wave slope exceeds 17°. Comparisons of velocity components and axial vorticity at four cross planes show that the method can accurately predict the wake of low axial velocity and vortical cross flow associated with the breaking bow wave. In addition, the simulation is used to explain the initial development of the overturning bow wave, induced vortices and scars and to fill in the relatively sparse experimental data set by providing a global picture of the axial vortex structure near the free surface.

  Abstract                 = {In volume of fluid methods for interfacial flow simulations, one essential process is the so-called interface reconstruction, in which an approximate interface is reconstructed from a given discrete volume fraction field. In [J. Comput. Phys. 164 (2000) 228–237], Scardovelli and Zaleski presented analytical relations connecting linear interfaces and volume fractions in rectangular grids. Here, we present analytical relations connecting linear interfaces and volume fractions in triangular and tetrahedral grids. For computing the volume of fluid in an arbitrary polygonal or polyhedral fluid element, we also cite some of the most efficient formulas for polygon area and polyhedron volume computations. Simple test cases show that this analytic method of interface reconstruction is about 18 times faster than an iterative method in two dimensions, and four to six times faster in three dimensions. The results can be in general applied to other fields as well. },

  Abstract                 = {We present an adaptive coupled level-set/volume-of-fluid (ACLSVOF) method for interfacial flow simulations on unstructured triangular grids. At each time step, we evolve both the level set function and the volume fraction. The level set function is evolved by solving the level set advection equation using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The volume fraction advection is performed using a Lagrangian–Eulerian method. The interface is reconstructed based on both the level set and the volume fraction information. In particular, the interface normal vector is calculated from the level set function while the line constant is determined by enforcing mass conservation based on the volume fraction. Different from previous works, we have developed an analytic method for finding the line constant on triangular grids, which makes interface reconstruction efficient and conserves volume of fluid exactly. The level set function is finally reinitialized to the signed distance to the reconstructed interface. Since the level set function is continuous, the normal vector calculation is easy and accurate compared to a classic volume-of-fluid method, while tracking the volume fraction is essential for enforcing mass conservation. The method is also coupled to a finite element based Stokes flow solver. The code validation shows that our method is second order and mass is conserved very accurately. In addition, owing to the adaptive grid algorithm we can resolve complex interface changes and interfaces of high curvature efficiently and accurately. },

The finite volume method is used to discretize the governing equations on a non-staggered grid with a four-step fractional step method. The free surface flow problem is converted into a two-phase flow system on a fixed grid in which the free surface is implicitly captured by the zero level set. We compare different numerical schemes for advection of the level set function in a generalized curvilinear format, including the third order quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics (QUICK) scheme, and the second and third order essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) schemes. The level set equations of evolution and reinitialization are validated with benchmark cases, e.g. a stationary circle, a rotating slotted disk and stretching of a circular fluid element. The coupled system is then applied to a travelling solitary wave, and two- and three-dimensional dam breaking problems. Some interesting free surface phenomena are revealed by the computational results, such as, the large free surface vortices, air entrapment and splashing of the water surge front.

The conservative and the standard level set methods are used. It is shown that a sharp surface tension force, expressed as a line integral along the interface, can give rise to large spurious currents and oscillations in the pressure that do not decrease with mesh refinement. If instead a regularized surface tension representation is used, exact force balance at the interface is possible, both for a fully coupled discretization approach and for a fractional step projection method. However, the numerical curvature calculation introduces errors that cause spurious currents. Different ways to extend the curvature from the interface to the whole domain are discussed and investigated. The impact of using different finite element spaces and stabilization methods is also considered. Copyright Â© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The free-surface flow problem is solved on a fixed grid in which the free surface is captured by the zero level set.

The standard level set method can capture the interface smoothly and gives accurate normal vectors but suffers from an excessive amount of mass gain/loss. The conservative level set method exhibits excellent mass conservation properties but the results are usually contaminated by inaccurate interface normal vectors. To address this problem, an improved conservative level set method is proposed to capture the interface smoothly with excellent mass conservation properties. The improvement of the method lies in that the surface normal is computed from a signed distance function which is also advected and re-initialized in the flow fields instead of using the Heaviside function. The proposed method is implemented by an implicit two-step Taylor–Galerkin approximation together with the fractional step algorithm within the finite element context. The approach is validated with well-known benchmark problems, including the long term advection of a circle, rotation of a slotted disk, stretching of a circular, dam-break flow and the Rayleigh–Taylor instability problem. The results from the proposed method show good agreement with existing experimental and numerical published results and are found to be highly reliable and accurate.},

  Abstract                 = {There are many challenges in the numerical simulation of liquid sloshing in horizontal cylinders and spherical containers using the finite element method of arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation: tracking the motion of the free surface with the contact points, defining the mesh velocity on the curved wall boundary and updating the computational mesh. In order to keep the contact points slipping along the curved side wall, the shape vector in each time advancement is defined to modify the kinematical boundary conditions on the free surface. A special function is introduced to automatically smooth the nodal velocities on the curved wall boundary based on the liquid nodal velocities. The elliptic partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions can directly rezone the inner nodal velocities in more than a single freedom. The incremental fractional step method is introduced to solve the finite element liquid equations. The numerical results that stemmed from the algorithm show good agreement with experimental phenomena, which demonstrates that the ALE method provides an efficient computing scheme in moving curved wall boundaries. This method can be extended to 3D cases by improving the technique to compute the shape vector. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1995 the two senior authors of the present paper introduced a new algorithm designed to replace the Taylor–Galerkin (or Lax–Wendroff) methods, used by them so far in the solution of compressible flow problems. The new algorithm was applicable to a wide variety of situations, including fully incompressible flows and shallow water equations, as well as supersonic and hypersonic situations, and has proved to be always at least as accurate as other algorithms currently used. The algorithm is based on the solution of conservation equations of fluid mechanics to avoid any possibility of spurious solutions that may otherwise result. The main aspect of the procedure is to split the equations into two parts, (1) a part that is a set of simple scalar equations of convective–diffusion type for which it is well known that the characteristic Galerkin procedure yields an optimal solution; and (2) the part where the equations are self-adjoint and therefore discretized optimally by the Galerkin procedure. It is possible to solve both the first and second parts of the system explicitly, retaining there the time step limitations of the Taylor–Galerkin procedure. But it is also possible to use semi-implicit processes where in the first part we use a much bigger time step generally governed by the Peclet number of the system while the second part is solved implicitly and is unconditionally stable. It turns out that the characteristic-based-split (CBS) process allows equal interpolation to be used for all system variables without difficulties when the incompressible or nearly incompressible stage is reached. It is hoped that the paper will help to make the algorithm more widely available and understood by the profession and that its advantages can be widely realised.

  abstract = {Sloshing of fluids with a free surface contained in liquid storage
	tanks is numerically simulated by an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
	formulation. The fluid is considered viscous and Newtonian, while
	the flow is assumed laminar and incompressible. A partitioned and
	distributed computational code is employed, which solves three instances
	each time step: (i) the determination of the fluid state, given by
	the Navier?Stokes equations; (ii) the displacement of the free surface;
	and (iii) the update of the position of the internal nodes of the
	mesh, that is deformed as a consequence of the free surface displacement.
	The purpose of the work is verifying the applicability of the method
	to sloshing problems with known solutions, as well as the resolution
	of some practical examples. Numerical examples include validations
	against analytical solutions, where the wave period and damping rate
	are well captured, comparisons with reference results from other
	authors and a sample of sloshing induced by seismic actions.},

  abstract = {In the present work the problem of generating synthesized turbulence
	at inflow boundaries of the simulation domain is addressed in the
	context of the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method. To represent adequately

	a synthesized turbulence method which is based on previous works
	(Huang et al., 2010; Smirnov et al., 2001) [15,28]. For this purpose,
	time and space correlations are introduced strictly in the mathematical
	formulation of the synthetic turbulence inflow data. It is demonstrated
	that the proposed approach inherits the properties of the methods
	on which it is based while presents some particular advantages as
	well. The strategy of imposing conditions on the inlet velocity field
	through turbulence synthesis is implemented in the parallel multiphysics
	code called PETSc-FEM (http://www.cimec.org.ar/petscfem) primarily
	targeted to calculations throughout finite elements on general unstructured
	2D and 3D grids. We present several numerical tests in order to validate
	and evaluate the method describing the dynamic phenomena that take

	inside a diffuser and the airflow around a vehicle model inside a
	wind tunnel at high Reynolds number. },

  abstract = {A tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) for the control of vibration of
	tall buildings comprises two vertical columns of liquid connected
	by a horizontal cross-over duct of the same width. A variation of
	this, with a cross-over duct different in width, is denoted as a
	liquid column vibration absorber (LCVA). Both TLCDs and LCVAs have
	been shown to be effective passive vibration control devices as long
	as their vibrational characteristics are properly designed in relation
	to those of the building in which they are installed. In previous
	research, prediction of the natural frequency of these dampers is
	based on the assumption that the liquid velocity within each leg
	of these dampers is constant and the transition between vertical
	and horizontal flows occurs at a single point. This assumption is
	valid for a TLCD and a LCVA when the widths of both the horizontal
	cross-over duct and the vertical columns are small compared to the
	overall dimensions of the damper. Different researchers have also
	suggested empirical modifications of this assumption for TLCDs, resulting
	in different estimates of the system?s natural frequencies. For buildings
	with limited space, it will be necessary to configure a TLCD with
	a width of vertical columns that is not small with respect to the
	overall dimensions of the damper, a configuration which has not yet
	been investigated in research. In this case, the variation in liquid
	velocity in the relatively large transition zone between the vertical
	columns and the cross-over duct cannot be ignored. A numerical potential-flow
	method, known as the numerical panel method, is utilized to simulate
	the velocity distribution of the fluid inside liquid dampers. The
	method allows an integral equation for the velocity potential to
	be formulated and solved numerically to determine the flow. These
	numerical solutions are verified with those obtained from existing
	experimental results. In addition, three full-scale models of LCVAs
	are investigated experimentally under free-vibration, spectral and
	prescribed base excitations. The results from the numerical panel
	method lead to improved prediction of the characteristics of TLCDs
	over a wide range of configurations, which is essential in controlling
	problems for the optimum performance of buildings.},

  abstract = {A novel, time-independent finite-difference method for analyzing complete
	two-dimensional sloshing motion (surge, heave and pitch) in a tank
	has been developed based on the primitive 2D Navier?Stokes equations.
	Both the fully non-linear free surface condition and fluid viscosity
	are included. The boundary of the tank is mapped onto a fixed square
	domain through proper mapping functions and stretched meshes are
	employed near boundaries in order to more accurately evaluate the
	large disturbance of fluid along the boundary. The sloshing displacement
	agrees well with previously published results. The maximum transient
	amplitude is much larger than that of the steady-state. Clear beating
	phenomenon can be found when the tank is excited by near resonance
	frequency. The frequency dependence and Reynolds number effects are
	studied. For a fixed forcing-function amplitude, the sloshing response
	is greatest near resonance. An analysis under coupled surge and pitch
	motions is also made. The coupling effect is significant and simultaneous
	surge, heave and pitch motions should be included in the tank sloshing
	analysis. A simple formula is derived to approximate the horizontal
	force coefficient, CF, on the tank walls. The formula implies that
	\{CF\} is dominated by the free surface displacement when the tank
	is excited by small surge frequencies. Whereas \{CF\} is attributed
	to added mass effects when the tank is under higher surge frequency
	forcing. A power spectra analysis is made to analyze the time series
	of sloshing displacement. For lower frequency of excitation, the
	system presents two peaks corresponding to the forcing frequency
	and fundamental frequency of the system. For higher frequency of
	excitation, the system shows only one major peak at the fundamental
	frequency. The limitations of the proposed method are also discussed.

  abstract = {A numerical procedure based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
	description of flow is developed to simulate free surface problems.
	The conservation equations are rewritten using a referential kinematic
	description where the grid points move independently of the fluid
	particles. In all the applications considered in this work, the fluid
	domain is bounded below by a rigid impermeable wall and above by
	a vapor-liquid moving interface. The free surface is taken to be
	resting on vertical spines and the grid points slide up and down
	along the vertical spines. The two-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes
	equations are discretized in time using Chorin type Projection scheme
	and pressure is determined from the Poisson equation. Galerkin Finite
	Element Method with three node triangular elements has been used
	for spatial discretization Hydraulic jump with inlet supercritical
	Froude number 2.0 is solved. The turbulence is modeled using a two-equation
	k-? closure model. The surface roller and small recirculation zone
	near the foot of the jump are found to influence the turbulence characteristics
	of the jump significantly. The next application considered is the
	combined buoyancy-driven and thermocapillary-induced convective flows
	in crystal growth melts. The influence of various parameters on the
	flow field and free surface deformation is studied. Lastly, the instabilities
	in the thin film flows draining down an inclined plane arc studied.
	The results are compared with the available linear stability and
	non-linear evolution equation results. The phase transition from
	supercritical to subcritical is investigated in greater detail.},

	as fuel or water sloshing in tanks, waves breaking in ships, offshore
	platforms, harbours and coastal areas. The computation of such highly
	nonlinear flows is challenging since free-surfaces commonly present
	merging, fragmentation and breaking parts, leading to the use of
	interface-capturing Eulerian approaches. In such methods the surface
	between two fluids is captured by the use of a marking function which
	is transported in a flow field. In this work we present a three-dimensional
	parallel edge-based incompressible SUPG/PSPG finite element method
	to cope with free-surface problems with volume-of-fluid (VOF) extensions
	to track the evolving free surface. The pure advection equation for
	the scalar marking function was solved by a fully implicit parallel
	edge-based SUPG finite element formulation. We studied variants of
	this formulation, considering the effects of discontinuity capturing
	and a particular tangent transformation designed to increase interface
	sharpness. Global mass conservation is enforced adding or removing
	mass proportionally to the absolute value of the normal velocity
	of the interface. We introduce a parallel dynamic deactivation algorithm
	to solve the marking function equation only in a small region around
	the interface. The implementation is targeted to distributed memory
	systems with cache-based processors. The performance and accuracy
	of the proposed solution method were tested with several validation
	problems.},

  abstract = {A fully nonlinear 2-D ? -transformed finite difference solver has
	been developed based on inviscid flow equations in rectangular tanks.
	The fluid equations are coupled to a linear elastic support structure.
	Nonoverturning sloshing motions are simulated during structural vibration
	cycles at and outside resonance. The wave tank acts as a tuned liquid
	damper (TLD). The \{TLD\} response is highly nonlinear when large
	liquid sloshing occurs. The solver is valid at any water depth except
	for small depth when shallow water waves and viscous effects would
	become important. Results of liquid sloshing induced by horizontal
	base excitations are presented for small to steep nonbreaking waves
	at tank aspect ratios, depth to length, h/b of 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125,
	representing deep to near shallow water cases. The effectiveness
	of the \{TLD\} is discussed through predictions of coupling frequencies
	and response of the tank-structural system for different tank sizes
	and mass ratios between fluid and structure. An effective tank-structural
	system typically displays two distinct frequencies with reduced structural
	response (e.g., h / b = 0.5 ). These eigenfrequencies differ considerably
	from their noninteracting values. Hardening or softening spring behavior
	of the fluid, known to be present in solutions of pure sloshing motion
	in tanks, does not exists in the coupled system response. Strongest
	interactions occur with only one dominating sloshing mode when the
	nth sloshing frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure,
	as the mass ratio between fluid and structure ? ? 0 . Inclusion of
	higher modes reduces the efficiency of the TLD. Good agreement is
	achieved between the numerical model and a first-order potential
	theory approximation outside the resonance region when the unsteady
	sloshing motions remain small. When the free-surface amplitudes become
	large in the coupled system, the numerical peaks are larger and the
	troughs become lower as time evolves (typical nonlinear effects)
	compared to the linear solution. Nonlinearities were found to reduce
	the system displacement significantly, e.g., system resonance shifted
	to beating response, compared to linear predictions. It was also
	found that the system response is extremely sensitive to small changes
	in forcing frequency. In conclusion, if strong interaction exists,
	the coupled system exhibits nonlinearity in structural and free-surface
	response, but the coupled eigenfrequencies compare well with the
	linear predictions. Furthermore, the solver removes the need for
	free-surface smoothing for the cases considered herein (maximum wave
	steepness of 1.2). The numerical model provides a quick and accurate
	way of determining system eigenfrequencies which can be hard to identify
	and interpret in physical experiments.},

  abstract = {For many problems in ship hydrodynamics, the effects of air flow on
	the water flow are negligible (the frequently called free surface
	conditions), but the air flow around the ship is still of interest.
	A method is presented where the water flow is decoupled from the
	air solution, but the air flow uses the unsteady water flow as a
	boundary condition. The authors call this a semi-coupled air/water
	flow approach. The method can be divided into two steps. At each
	time step the free surface water flow is computed first with a single-phase
	method assuming constant pressure and zero stress on the interface.
	The second step is to compute the air flow assuming the free surface
	as a moving immersed boundary (IB). The IB method developed for Cartesian
	grids (Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 2005; 37:239-261) is extended to curvilinear
	grids, where no-slip and continuity conditions are used to enforce
	velocity and pressure boundary conditions for the air flow. The forcing
	points close to the IB can be computed and corrected under a sharp
	interface condition, which makes the computation very stable. The
	overset implementation is similar to that of the single-phase solver
	(Comput. Fluids 2007; 36:1415-1433), with the difference that points
	in water are set as IB points even if they are fringe points. Pressure-velocity
	coupling through pressure implicit with splitting of operators or
	projection methods is used for water computations, and a projection
	method is used for the air. The method on each fluid is a single-phase
	method, thus avoiding ill-conditioned numerical systems caused by
	large differences of fluid properties between air and water. The
	computation is only slightly slower than the single-phase version,
	with complete absence of spurious velocity oscillations near the
	free surface, frequently present in fully coupled approaches. Validations
	are performed for laminar Couette flow over a wavy boundary by comparing
	with the analytical solution, and for the surface combatant model
	David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) 5512 by comparing with Experimental
	Fluid Dynamics (EFD) and the results of two-phase level set computations.
	Complex flow computations are demonstrated for the ONR Tumblehome

  abstract = {A coupled ghost fluid/two-phase level set method to simulate air/water

	interface flows was based on Heaviside functions to smooth all fluid
	properties across the interface. We call this the Heaviside function
	method (HFM). The HFM requires fine grids across the interface. The
	ghost fluid method (GFM) has been designed to explicitly enforce
	the interfacial jump conditions, but the implementation of the jump
	conditions in curvilinear grids is intricate. To overcome these difficulties
	a coupled GFM/HFM method was developed in which approximate jump
	conditions are derived for piezometric pressure and velocity and
	pressure gradients based on exact continuous velocity and stress
	and jump in momentum conditions with the jump in density maintainedbut
	continuity of the molecular and turbulent viscosities imposed. The
	implementation of the ghost points is such that no duplication of
	memory storage is necessary. The level set method is adopted to locate
	the air/water interface, and a fast marching method was implemented
	in curvilinear grids to reinitialize the level set function. Validations
	are performed for three tests: super- and sub-critical flow without
	wave breaking and an impulsive plunging wave breaking over 2D submerged
	bumps, and the flow around surface combatant model DTMB 5512. Comparisons
	are made against experimental data, HFM and single-phase level set
	computations. The proposed method performed very well and shows great

  abstract = {This study considers the coupling effects of ship motion and sloshing.
	The linear ship motion is solved using an impulse-response-function
	(IRF) method, while the nonlinear sloshing flow is simulated using
	a finite-difference method. The \{IRF\} method requires the frequency-domain
	solution prior to conversion to time domain, but the computational
	effort is much less than that of direct time-domain approaches. The
	developed scheme is verified by comparing the motion \{RAOs\} between
	the frequency-domain solution and the solution obtained by the \{IRF\}
	method. Furthermore, a soft-spring concept and linear roll damping
	are implemented to predict more realistic motions of surge, sway,
	yaw, and roll. For the simulation of sloshing flow in liquid tanks,
	a physics-based numerical approach adopted by Kim [2001. Numerical
	simulation of sloshing flows with impact load. Applied Ocean Research
	23, 53?62] and Kim et al. [2004. Numerical study on slosh-induced
	impact pressures on three-dimensional prismatic tanks. Applied Ocean
	Research 26, 213?226] is applied. In particular, the present method
	focuses on the simulation of the global motion of sloshing flow,
	ignoring some local phenomena. The sloshing-induced forces and moments
	are added to wave-excitation forces and moments, and then the corresponding
	body motion is obtained. The developed schemes are applied for two
	problems: the sway motion of a box-type barge with rectangular tanks
	and the roll motion of a modified \{S175\} hull with rectangular
	anti-rolling tank. Motion \{RAOs\} are compared with existing results,
	showing fair agreement. It is found that the nonlinearity of sloshing
	flow is very important in coupling analysis. Due to the nonlinearity
	of sloshing flow, ship motion shows a strong sensitivity to wave
	slope. },

  abstract = {In this work, a technique for simultaneous untangling and smoothing
	of meshes is presented. It is based on an extension of an earlier
	mesh smoothing strategy developed to solve the computational mesh
	dynamics stage in fluid-structure interaction problems. In moving
	grid problems, mesh untangling is necessary when element inversion
	happens as a result of a moving domain boundary. The smoothing strategy,
	formerly published by the authors, is defined in terms of the minimization
	of a functional associated with the mesh distortion by using a geometric
	indicator of the element quality. This functional becomes discontinuous
	when an element has null volume, making it impossible to obtain a
	valid mesh from an invalid one. To circumvent this drawback, the
	functional proposed is transformed in order to guarantee its continuity
	for the whole space of nodal coordinates, thus achieving the untangling
	technique. This regularization depends on one parameter, making the
	recovery of the original functional possible as this parameter tends
	to 0. This feature is very important: consequently, it is necessary
	to regularize the functional in order to make the mesh valid; then,
	it is advisable to use the original functional to make the smoothing
	optimal. Finally, the simultaneous untangling and smoothing technique
	is applied to several test cases, including 2D and 3D meshes with
	simplicial elements. As an additional example, the application of
	this technique to a mesh generation case is presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) utilize sloshing fluid to absorb
	and dissipate structural vibrational energy. A prerequisite to \{TLD\}
	design is establishing a suitable model to describe the fluid response.
	Numerous fluid models have been presented in literature; each utilizes
	simplifying assumptions which make the model valid under certain
	flow conditions. \{TLDs\} are often designed with fluid depth to
	tank length ratios less than 25%. At these depths, response characteristics
	change relatively rapidly with decreasing fluid depth, making it
	unlikely that one model is suitable over the entire range. The goal
	of this study is to determine when certain fluid models can be used.
	Three fluid models are considered: shallow water wave theory, a small
	depth multimodal model, and an intermediate depth multimodal model.
	The models are briefly presented and their basic assumptions are
	identified. A parametric shake table testing program is conducted
	which varies the fluid depth of a rectangular tank equipped with
	damping screens. Experimental time history and frequency response
	plots are created for comparison with each fluid model at several
	fluid depth ratios and excitation amplitudes. The range of validity
	for each model is described in terms of the fluid depth ratio, and
	the Ursell parameter. The results of this study will help \{TLD\}
	designers determine a suitable fluid model for dynamic analysis of
	a structure-TLD system. },

	liquid damper (TLD) tank, forcing a tank of complex geometry to be

	and a design procedure for this type of TLD is unavailable.
	
	Obtaining suitable TLD dimensions and damping screen properties is
	paramount to TLD efficiency. This study develops a preliminary design
	procedure for a TLD of complex tank geometry coupled to a 1D structure.
	First, a linearized equivalent mechanical model representing the
	fluid is coupled to a linear 1D structure to predict the structure-TLD
	interaction. Since the structure is 1D, the mechanical model properties
	are transformed to be aligned with the structural direction of motion.
	Structure-TLD system tests are conducted to show that the transformed
	TLD properties can be used to model the system.
	
	A design methodology is presented which enables a TLD tank to be designed
	to conform to space restrictions. To do this, the transformed TLD
	properties are related to the tank shape using normalized charts.
	The charts enable a designer to rapidly match transformed TLD properties
	to a specific tank shape. A tank shape that simultaneously satisfies
	the geometric restrictions, structure-TLD mass ratio, and natural
	frequency can be identified from a single chart. Subsequently, charts
	are used to identify the proper fluid depth and damping screen properties.
	An example is used to demonstrate the design method, and the resultant
	TLD?s performance is found to meet the design requirements using
	the mechanical model.},

	free-surface flows in naval engineering applications. State-of-the-art
	numerical methods based on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations
	are used to predict the flow around different classes of boats.
	
	
	 We investigate the role of the Computational Fluid Dynamics in the
	design of racing boats, such as America's Cup yachts and Olympic
	class rowing hull. The mathematical models describing the different
	aspects of the physical problem, as well as the numerical methods
	adopted for their solution, are introduced and critically discussed.
	The different phases of the overall numerical simulation procedure,
	from grid generation through the solution of the flow equations to
	the post-processing of the results, are described.
	
	
	 We present the numerical simulations that have been performed to
	investigate the role of different design parameters in the conception
	of America's Cup yachts and we describe how the results obtained
	from the simulations are integrated into the overall design process.
	
	
	 The free-surface flow around an Olympic rowing boat is also considered.
	We propose a simplified approach to take into account the effect
	of the boat dynamics in the prediction of the hydrodynamic forces
	acting on the boat. Based on the results of the simulations, we propose
	a new design concept and we investigate its potential benefits on
	the boat performances.
	
	
	 One of the aspects that is found to be not completely satisfactory,
	within the standard numerical methods adopted, is the modelling of
	complex free-surface flows. The second part of this thesis is devoted
	to a more theoretical and methodological investigation of this aspect.
	
	
	 In particular, we present and analyse a new numerical method based
	on the level set approach for the solution of two-fluid flows. The
	numerical scheme based on a finite element discretization is introduced
	and different critical aspects of its implementation are discussed.
	In particular, we present and analyse a new technique for the stabilization
	of the advection equation associated to the level set problem. Moreover,
	we propose a new reinitialization procedure for the level set function
	which plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the algorithm. The
	convergence properties of this procedure are analysed and comparisons
	with more standard approaches are presented.
	
	
	 Finally, the proposed method has been used to solve a variety of
	test cases concerning time dependent two-fluid viscous flows. The
	results of the simulation are presented and discussed.},

	the boundary were evaluated using Fourier analysis, and the particles
	on the transparent boundary were forced to move at the velocity of
	the analytical solution for Stokes waves in order to absorb the incident
	waves. The analysis was restricted to periodic waves. Wave propagation
	was simulated for two wave periods using the developed transparent
	boundary condition. The results showed that this transparent boundary
	transmitted the incident waves with small reflection and the simulation
	cost was lower than that for wave damping by a conventional highly
	viscous region.},

	modeling of fluid mechanics problems is normally chosen according
	to a simplified analysis of the characteristics, and also from the
	experience of the modeler. The problem is harder at inflow/outflow
	boundaries which are, in most cases, artificial boundaries, so that
	a bad decision about the boundary conditions to be imposed may affect
	the precision and stability of the whole computation. For inviscid
	flows, the analysis of the sense of propagation in the normal direction
	to the boundaries gives the number of conditions to be imposed and,
	in addition, the conditions that are 'absorbing' for the waves impinging
	normally to the boundary. In practice, it amounts to counting the
	number of positive and negative eigenvalues of the advective flux
	Jacobian projected onto the normal. The problem is even harder when
	the number of incoming characteristics varies during the computation,
	and the correct treatment of these cases poses both mathematical
	and practical problems. One example considered here is a compressible
	flow where the flow regime at a certain part of an inlet/outlet boundary
	can change from subsonic to supersonic and the flow can revert. In
	this work the technique for dynamically imposing the correct number

	A new type of numerical boundary condition for combined wave generation

	numerical boundary condition is based on an active wave absorption
	system that was first developed in the context of physical wave flume

	the incident wave field in front of a structure by means of digital
	filtering and subsequent superposition of the measured velocity signals.
	The incident wave signal is corrected, so that the reflected wave
	is effectively absorbed at the boundary. The digital filters are
	derived theoretically and their practical design is discussed. The
	practical use of this numerical boundary condition is compared to
	the use of the absorption system in a physical wave flume. The effectiveness

  journal = {Computers \& Mathematics with Applications },
  year = {2013},
  volume = {65},
  pages = {1163--1186},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Abstract A time-independent finite difference method is developed
	to simulate fluid sloshing in a three-dimensional tank. The developed
	numerical scheme is verified by the rigorous benchmark tests. The
	experiment measurement of liquid sloshing in a 3D tank was also carried
	out in this study to further validate the accuracy of the present
	numerical results. Transient waves can change their types naturally
	in the time domain, especially for a tank excited by resonant frequencies.
	In this study, if the excitation frequencies are far from the fundamental
	natural frequency and there are four types of stable sloshing waves
	discovered due to the oblique horizontal excitation: ?diagonal?,
	?single-directional?, ?square-like?, and ?irregular? waves. Besides,
	the swirling waves can only be generated for a partially-filled tank
	excited at near resonant frequency with oblique horizontal excitation.
	The evolution of forces induced by different sloshing waves acting
	on the tank walls is calculated and discussed in this work. In addition,
	the dynamics of sloshing force induced by swirling waves are explored
	in detail. The force of the single-directional waves acting on the
	tank bottom is time-invariant but the other types of sloshing waves
	show a beating phenomenon which is attributed to the momentum flux
	across the free surface and the vertical inertia of sloshing fluid.
	The effect of various oblique excitation directions of the tank on
	liquid sloshing is discussed as well. The horizontal hydrodynamic
	force of sloshing waves acting on the mid-section of the left wall
	of the tank is dominated by the added mass effect if the external
	excitation frequency is larger than 4 times the lowest natural frequency
	( ? 1 ) of the tank with partially-filled fluid. On the other hand,
	the wave elevation of sloshing waves plays a key effect on the horizontal
	sloshing-induced force when the excitation frequency of the tank
	is less than 4 ? 1 . A novel mechanism is presented to describe the
	phenomenon of alternate switch directions of the swirling waves.
	The relationship between the external force and the sloshing hydrodynamic
	force is the major factor to trigger the switch direction of the
	swirling waves. The influence of different base ratios of a rectangular
	tank on kinematic and dynamic responses of sloshing fluid is also
	explored in this work. },

abstract = "Abstract This paper presents a research work estimating the impact of propellant sloshing on the pointing-stability of the \{EUCLID\} satellite, for a pre-design phase of the project. The analysis is carried out by means of computational fluid dynamics. Two tank fill ratios have been considered: 22% and 50%, with an elastomeric and deformable bladder. To support the analysis, two different test cases have been created for the validation of the numerical approach. The first case is related to the analysis of a cylindrical tank with no bladder, and its importance consists in the determination of the correct computational fluid dynamics setup for sloshing simulations. For this test case, sloshing frequency is compared between computational results and the results of the analytical models available. The second test case is created to verify the procedure adopted for bladder simulation; therefore, it consists in the numerical simulation of a bladdered tank. For this case, the available experimental results have been used for a comparison with the output of the computational fluid dynamics analysis. This work is the first aiming at representing bladdered tanks using computational fluid dynamics without recurring to fluid–structure interaction techniques. Moreover, it proposes a new method for the calibration of the traditional sloshing lumped model, based on computational fluid dynamics, which could reduce development costs of experiments. "

abstract = "The numerical analysis of liquid sloshing in tanks is a big challenge when the fully nonlinear and viscous effects are all included in the analysis. The analysis will become more complicate as the tank is attached with internal structures, such as baffles. The width of the baffle is very thin compared with the breadth length and the numerical technique used to capture the detailed flow phenomenon (vortex generation and shedding) around the baffle is very rare in the literatures. In this paper, a time-independent finite difference scheme with fictitious cell technique is used to study viscous fluid sloshing in 2D tanks with baffles. The Navier–Stokes equations in a moving coordinate system are derived and they are mapped onto a time-independent and stretched domain. The developed numerical model is rigorously validated by extensive comparisons with reported results. An experiment setup was also made to validate the present numerical sloshing results in a tank with baffles. The method is applied to a number of problems including impulsive flow past a flat plate, sloshing fluid in a 2D tank with a surface-piercing baffle, sloshing fluid in 2D tanks with bottom-mounted baffles. The effects of baffles on the resonant frequency are discussed. The present developed numerical model can successfully analyze the sloshing phenomenon in 2D tanks with internal structures and can be easily extended to 3D model. "

In a dispersed flow, where the dimensions of the particular fluid parts are comparable or smaller than the grid spacing, several numerical and reconstruction errors become considerable. In this paper the analysis of the interface tracking errors is performed for the volume-of-fluid method with the least squares volume of fluid interface reconstruction algorithm. A few simple two-fluid benchmarks are proposed for the investigation of the interface tracking grid dependence. The expression based on the gradient of the volume fraction variable is introduced for the estimation of the reconstruction correctness and can be used for the activation of an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm.

  Abstract                 = {In computation of flow problems with fluid–solid interfaces, an interface-tracking technique, where the fluid mesh moves to track the interface, would allow us to have full control of the resolution of the fluid mesh in the boundary layers. With an interface-capturing technique (or an interface locator technique in the more general case), on the other hand, independent of how accurately the interface geometry is represented, the resolution of the fluid mesh in the boundary layer will be limited by the resolution of the fluid mesh at the interface. In computation of flow problems with fluid–fluid interfaces where the interface is too complex or unsteady to track while keeping the remeshing frequency under control, interface-capturing techniques, with enhanced-discretization as needed, could be used as more flexible alternatives. Sometimes we may need to solve flow problems with both fluid–solid interfaces and complex or unsteady fluid–fluid interfaces. The Mixed Interface-Tracking/Interface-Capturing Technique (MITICT) was introduced for computation of flow problems that involve both interfaces that can be accurately tracked with a moving mesh method and interfaces that are too complex or unsteady to be tracked and therefore require an interface-capturing technique. As the interface-tracking technique, we use the Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized Space–Time (DSD/SST) formulation. The interface-capturing technique rides on this, and is based on solving over a moving mesh, in addition to the Navier–Stokes equations, the advection equation governing the time-evolution of the interface function. For the computations reported in this paper, as interface-capturing technique we are using one of the versions of the Edge-Tracked Interface Locator Technique (ETILT).},

The method is based on the variational framework that is suitable for discretization by standard finite elements as well as the basis functions employed in isogeometric analysis. The underlying numerical formulation globally conserves mass and preserves a sharp air–water interface for the entire length of the simulation. The numerical tests indicate that the proposed methodology gives an accurate description of the free-surface behavior in both quasi-steady and dynamic regimes. Furthermore, very good per-degree-of-freedom accuracy is obtained when higher-order and higher-continuity isogeometric discretizations are employed in free-surface computations. },

  Abstract                 = {The coupling between the equations governing the free-surface flows, the six degrees of freedom non-linear rigid body dynamics, the linear elasticity equations for mesh-moving and the cables has resulted in a fluid-structure interaction technology capable of simulating mooring forces on floating objects. The finite element solution strategy is based on a combination approach derived from fixed-mesh and moving-mesh techniques. Here, the free-surface flow simulations are based on the Navier–Stokes equations written for two incompressible fluids where the impact of one fluid on the other one is extremely small. An interface function with two distinct values is used to locate the position of the free-surface. The stabilized finite element formulations are written and integrated in an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian domain. This allows us to handle the motion of the time dependent geometries. Forces and momentums exerted on the floating object by both water and hawsers are calculated and used to update the position of the floating object in time. In the mesh moving scheme, we assume that the computational domain is made of elastic materials. The linear elasticity equations are solved to obtain the displacements for each computational node. The non-linear rigid body dynamics equations are coupled with the governing equations of fluid flow and are solved simultaneously to update the position of the floating object. The numerical examples includes a 3D simulation of water waves impacting on a moored floating box and a model boat and simulation of floating object under water constrained with a cable.

We discuss the issues involved in formulating diffuse-interface models for single-component and binary fluids. Recent applications and computations using these models are discussed in each case.

This algorithm is based on a combination of a Computational Lagrangian–Eulerian Advection Remap and the Volume of the Fluid method (CLEAR-VOF). A set of geometric tools are used to remap the advected shape of the volume fraction from one cell onto the Eulerian fixed unstructured grid. The geometric remapping is used to compute the fluxes onto a group of neighbouring cells of the mesh. These fluxes are then redistributed and corrected to satisfy the conservation of mass. Here, we present methods for developing identification algorithms for surface cells and incorporating them with CLEAR-VOF. The CLEAR-VOF algorithm is then tested for translation of several geometries. It is also incorporated in a finite element based flow solver and tested in a laminar flow over a broad-crested weir and a turbulent flow over a semi-circular obstacle.

  Abstract                 = {In this work we present a new interface tracking algorithm based on surface markers to reconstruct and advect interfaces in three-dimensional space. The algorithm is coupled to a marker redistribution method, which is area-preserving along the interface. The interface is described by a set of closed lines which define a coarse Lagrangian quadrangular mesh in the fixed computational grid. Fixed markers are located where the lines cross and are maintained during the whole simulation. At each time step the interface is first reconstructed and then all markers are advected by following streamlines. In the reconstruction step, new markers are determined by computing the intersections of the interface lines with the grid cell faces and by adding area conservation markers between fixed and grid intersection markers. Intersection and conservation markers defined at the previous time step are discarded. The method maintains a smooth geometrical description of the interface for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional tests with accurate volume conservation even in very challenging situations where the fluid bodies progressively deform and stretch developing localized regions with very high curvature and thin fluid filaments. The method compares favorably with front capturing methods, such as volume-of-fluid and level set, and other hybrid techniques, such as the particle level set method.},

The interface is described by using both the volume fraction function C, as in \{VOF\} methods, and surface markers, which locate the interface within the computational cells. The C field and the markers are advected by following the streamlines. New markers are determined by computing the intersections of the advected interface with the grid lines, then other markers are added inside each cut cell to conserve the volume fraction C. A smooth motion of the interface is obtained, typical of the marker approach, with a good volume conservation, as in standard \{VOF\} methods. In this article we consider a few typical two-dimensional tests and compare the results of the mixed algorithm with those obtained with \{VOF\} methods. Translations, rotations and vortex tests are performed showing that many problems of the \{VOF\} technique can be solved and a good accuracy in the geometrical motion and mass conservation can be achieved. },

Its performance is tested for several smooth surfaces against other simple reconstruction methods. Then Eulerian, Lagrangian and mixed split advection schemes are presented and analyzed.

A salient feature of the scheme is the absence of adjustable parameters. The algorithm is tested in two and three spatial dimensions and compared with the widely used partial differential equation (PDE)-based redistancing method using structured Cartesian grids. Through the use of quantitative error measures of interest in level set methods, we show that the overall performance of the proposed geometric procedure is better than PDE-based reinitialization schemes, since it is more robust with comparable accuracy. We also show that the algorithm is well-suited for the highly stretched curvilinear grids used in CFD simulations. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider incompressible Stokes flow with an internal interface at which the pressure is discontinuous, as happens for example in problems involving surface tension. We assume that the mesh does not follow the interface, which makes classical interpolation spaces to yield suboptimal convergence rates (typically, the interpolation error in the L 2 ( Ω ) -norm is of order h 1 2 ). We propose a modification of the P 1 -conforming space that accommodates discontinuities at the interface without introducing additional degrees of freedom or modifying the sparsity pattern of the linear system. The unknowns are the pressure values at the vertices of the mesh and the basis functions are computed locally at each element, so that the implementation of the proposed space into existing codes is straightforward. With this modification, numerical tests show that the interpolation order improves to O h 3 2 . The new pressure space is implemented for the stable P 1 + / P 1 mini-element discretization, and for the stabilized equal-order P 1 / P 1 discretization. Assessment is carried out for Poiseuille flow with a forcing surface and for a static bubble. In all cases the proposed pressure space leads to improved convergence orders and to more accurate results than the standard P 1 space. In addition, two Navier–Stokes simulations with moving interfaces (Rayleigh–Taylor instability and merging bubbles) are reported to show that the proposed space is robust enough to carry out realistic simulations.},

International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids 2000; 33: 375–403] to handle dynamic wetting. A generalization of the technique used in two-dimensional modeling to circumvent double-valued velocities at the wetting line, the so-called kinematic paradox, is presented for a wetting line in three dimensions. This approach requires the fluid velocity normal to the contact line to be zero, the fluid velocity tangent to the contact line to be equal to the tangential component of web velocity, and the fluid velocity into the web to be zero. In addition, slip is allowed in a narrow strip along the substrate surface near the dynamic contact line. For realistic wetting line motion, a contact angle that varies with wetting speed is required because contact lines in three dimensions typically advance or recede at different rates depending upon location and/or have both advancing and receding portions. The theory is applied to capillary rise of static fluid in a corner, the initial motion of a Newtonian droplet down an inclined plane, and extrusion of a Newtonian fluid from a nozzle onto a moving substrate. The extrusion results are compared with experimental visualization. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In LS approximations for two-fluid flow simulations, a scalar function indicates the presence of one or another phase and the interface between them. In general, the advection of such function produces a degradation of some properties of the LS function, such as the smoothness of the transition between phases and the correct position of the interface. The methodology introduced here, denominated bounded renormalization with continuous penalization, consists of solving by the finite element method a partial differential equation with certain distinguishing properties with the aim of keeping the desirable properties of the LS function. The performance of the strategy is evaluated for several typical cases in one, two and three-dimensional domains, for both the advection and the renormalization stages.

  Abstract                 = {Hydrodynamic simulations of sloshing phenomena often involve the application of slip boundary condition at the wetted surfaces. If these surfaces are curved, the ambiguous nature of the normal vector in the discretized problem can interfere with the application of such a boundary condition. Even the use of consistent normal vectors, preferred from the point of view of conservation, does not assure good approximation of the continuum slip condition in the discrete problem, and non-physical recirculating flow fields may be observed. As a remedy, we consider the Navier slip condition, and more successfully, the so-called BC-free boundary condition. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Focusing on the last issue, we present an extension of the free-surface elevation equation to cases where the prescribed direction of the surface node motion is not uniformly vertical. The resulting hyperbolic generalized elevation equation is discretized using a Galerkin/least-squares formulation applied on the surface mesh. The elevation field so obtained is then used to impose displacement boundary conditions on the elastic mesh update scheme that governs the movement of interior mesh nodes. The proposed method is used to solve a two-dimensional problem of sloshing in a trapezoidal tank, and a three-dimensional application involving flow in a trapezoidal channel with bridge supports.},

The resulting equations treat the continuum as a Hamiltonian system of particles where the constitutive equation of the continuum is represented via an internal energy term. For solids this internal energy is derived from the deformation gradient of the mapping in terms of a hyperelastic strain energy function. In the case of fluids, the internal energy term is a function of the density. Once the internal energy terms are established the equations of motion are developed as equations of Lagrange, where the Lagrangian coordinates are the current positions of the particles. Since the energy terms are independent of rigid body rotations and translations, this formulation ensures the preservation of physical constants of the motion such as linear and angular momentum.},

The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples.

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are assumed to hold in the liquid domain. In the gas domain, the velocity is disregarded, the pressure is supposed to be constant in each connected component of the gas domain and follows the ideal gas law. The gas pressure is imposed as a normal force on the liquid–gas interface. An implicit splitting scheme is used to decouple the physical phenomena. Given the gas pressure on the interface, the method described in [J. Comput Phys. 155 (1999) 439; Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 42(7) (2003) 697] is used to track the liquid domain and to compute the velocity and pressure fields in the liquid. Then the connected components of the gas domain are found using an original numbering algorithm. Finally, the gas pressure is updated from the ideal gas law in each connected component of gas. The implementation is validated in the frame of mould filling. Numerical results in two and three space dimensions show that the effect of pressure in the bubbles of gas trapped by the liquid cannot be neglected. },

  Abstract                 = {Computational fluid mechanics techniques for examining free surface problems in two-dimensional form are now well established. Extending these methods to three dimensions requires a reconsideration of some of the difficult issues from two-dimensional problems as well as developing new formulations to handle added geometric complexity. This paper presents a new finite element formulation for handling three-dimensional free surface problems with a boundary-fitted mesh and full Newton iteration, which solves for velocity, pressure, and mesh variables simultaneously. A boundary-fitted, pseudo-solid approach is used for moving the mesh, which treats the interior of the mesh as a fictitious elastic solid that deforms in response to boundary motion. To minimize mesh distortion near free boundary under large deformations, the mesh motion equations are rotated into normal and tangential components prior to applying boundary conditions. The Navier–Stokes equations are discretized using a Galerkin–least square/pressure stabilization formulation, which provides good convergence properties with iterative solvers. The result is a method that can track large deformations and rotations of free surface boundaries in three dimensions. The method is applied to two sample problems: solid body rotation of a fluid and extrusion from a nozzle with a rectangular cross-section. The extrusion example exhibits a variety of free surface shapes that arise from changing processing conditions. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of turbulence and surface tension models in the prediction of the interface position in a long-term analysis. Additionally, dimensional effects are analyzed by carrying out both 2D and 3D simulations. Design/methodology/approach – Finite volume simulations performed with the different models are compared between them and contrasted with numerical results computed using other numerical techniques and experimental data. Findings – The reported numerical results are in general in good agreement with experimental results available in the literature. They are also consistent with numerical solutions of other authors obtained using different numerical techniques. The results show that the laminar simulations exhibit strong mesh size dependency, while the turbulence models seem to help in producing mesh-independent solutions. Surface tension modeling does not seem to play a relevant role in the interface evolution. Practical implications – Model validation. Originality/value – The value of the present work encompass the comparison of different flow conditions used to simulate a free surface problem and their validation by contrasting numerical results with experiments. Also, the results shown in the present work are a contribution to the understanding of the role of some specific aspects of the models in the simulation of the proposed problem. },

  Abstract                 = {The mechanisms of broaching in following regular waves are studied by analysis of free model computations. Simulations of the fully appended \{ONR\} Tumblehome model \{DTMB\} 5613 are performed with the ship hydrodynamics code CFDShip-Iowa v4.5 and validated against experiments of an auto-piloted, self propelled model ship. Appendages include bilge keels, skeg, shafts and struts, moving rudders to control heading, and rotating propellers for self-propulsion. Proportional and proportional–integral autopilots are used. Once validated against experimental data for the proportional controller, the flow field and forces and moments on the hull and individual appendages are analyzed in detail to identify the mechanisms leading to the broaching event. It was found that several reasons contribute to the inability of the ship to overcome the hydrostatic yaw moment caused by the approaching wave. However, it is shown that the use of a slightly better autopilot prevents broaching under identical operating conditions, presenting an opportunity to extend the safe operating envelope of the ship. },

  Abstract                 = {The problem of surface ships free to pitch and heave in regular head waves is analyzed numerically with an unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) approach. The unsteady single-phase level set method previously developed by the authors was extended to include six degrees of freedom (6DOF) motions. The method uses rigid overset grids that move with relative motion during the computation, and the interpolation coefficients between the grids are recomputed dynamically every time the grids move. The motions in each time step are integrated implicitly using a predictor–corrector approach. An earth-based reference system is used for the solution of the fluid flow, while a ship-based reference system is used to compute the rigid-body equations of motion. Predicted results for sinkage and trim and resistance at two Froude numbers (medium, Fr&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.28 and large, Fr&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.41) were compared against experimental data, showing good agreement. Pitch and heave motions were computed for near-resonant cases at Fr&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.28 and 0.41, with regular linear head waves with slope ak&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025 and wavelength λ&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.5L, with L the ship length. The predicted motions compare favorably with existing experimental data. A solution for a large amplitude head wave case (ak&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.075) was also obtained, in which the transom wave breaks and extreme motions are observed. The medium Froude number case was subject to a verification and validation analysis. A problem with two ships pitching and heaving one behind the other is demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {The single-phase level set method for unsteady viscous free surface flows is presented. In contrast to the standard level set method for incompressible flows, the single-phase level set method is concerned with the solution of the flow field in the water (or the denser) phase only. Some of the advantages of such an approach are that the interface remains sharp, the computation is performed within a fluid with uniform properties and that only minor computations are needed in the air. The location of the interface is determined using a signed distance function, and appropriate interpolations at the fluid/fluid interface are used to enforce the jump conditions. A reinitialization procedure has been developed for non-orthogonal grids with large aspect ratios. A convective extension is used to obtain the velocities at previous time steps for the grid points in air, which allows a good estimation of the total derivatives. The method was applied to three unsteady tests: a plane progressive wave, sloshing in a two-dimensional tank, and the wave diffraction problem for a surface ship, and the results compared against analytical solutions or experimental data. The method can in principle be applied to any problem in which the standard level set method works, as long as the stress on the second phase can be specified (or neglected) and no bubbles appear in the flow during the computation.

The medium speed case (Fr&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.28) with long wavelength incident waves (λ&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.5L) behaves linearly and has been extensively compared against available experimental data for resistance and heave forces and pitching moment, unsteady free surface elevations, and unsteady velocity fields at the nominal wake plane (x/L&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.935). Quantitative verification and validation was performed for this case by running three grids and three time steps with refinement ratio of 2 and the flow field analyzed in detail. The behavior of the boundary layer is analyzed to explain the origin of large first harmonic amplitudes on the axial velocity observed both experimentally and numerically. The high speed case (Fr&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.41) with short wavelength incident waves (λ&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.5L) exhibits non-linear behavior on the forces and moment with a strong second harmonic component and an unsteady breaking bow wave. The second harmonic has been reproduced by the \{CFD\} computations and the breaking wave predicted. Analysis of the flow indicates that the breaking wave could be responsible for the non-linear behavior on the forces and moment.},

  Abstract                 = {A numerical study was undertaken in order to assess the capability of an unsteady \{RANS\} code to predict the seakeeping characteristics of a high-speed multi-hull vessel in high sea states. Numerical analysis includes evaluation of ship motions, effects of wave steepness on ship response, catamaran natural frequency and added resistance in waves. Computations were performed for the \{DELFT\} 372 catamaran by the \{URANS\} solver CFDSHIP-Iowa V.4. The code was validated with encouraging results for high ship speeds (0.3≤Fn≤0.75) and high wave amplitudes (0.025≤Ak≤0.1). Comparison with strip theory solutions shows that the \{RANS\} method predicts ship motions with higher accuracy and allows the detection of nonlinear effects. Current computations evidence that heave peaks occur at resonance for all Fn, and reach the absolute maximum at Fn=0.75. Maximum pitch occurs at frequencies lower than resonance, for each speed, and absolute maximum occurs at medium Fn=0.6. Maximum added resistance, Raw, was computed at Fn=0.45, which, interestingly, is near the catamaran Fncoincidence. Overall, we found similar results as Simonsen et al. (2008) for \{KCS\} containership, though, herein, a multi-hull geometry and higher speeds were tested. Also, our results are useful to further evaluate the exciting forces and their correlation with fe and λ/Lpp. },

In this paper we present a new method to interpolate the coarse velocity field which is based on an optimal approach and is characterized by a constrained minimization of an objective functional. The functional contains the sum of the square difference between the velocity components and their target average value subject to a number of divergence-free constraints. In this work we describe this approach in two- and three-dimensional geometries with different discrete velocity field configurations. This technique is applied to a multilevel Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method where the volume fraction function is used to reconstruct and advect the interface between two immiscible phases. The coarse velocity field is interpolated to a fixed fine grid with the optimal approach over a given number of refinement levels. The results of several kinematic tests are presented, where the mass and geometrical errors are compared with those obtained with refined velocity fields interpolated with a simple midpoint rule. },

Since the structural dynamic behaviour is strongly coupled with interior liquid motion, the design of a fuel-storage tank securing the structural stability becomes the appropriate suppression of the flow motion, which is in turn related to the baffle design. In order to numerically investigate the parametric dynamic characteristics of moving tanks, we employ the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) finite element method that is widely being used to deal with the problems with free surface, moving boundary, large deformation and interface contact. Following the theoretical and numerical formulations of fluid-structure interaction problems, we present parametric numerical results of a cylindrical fuel-storage tank moving with uniform vertical acceleration, with respect to the baffle number and location, and the inner-hole diameter.

  Abstract                 = {The numerical simulation of nonlinear gravity waves propagating at the surface of a perfect fluid is now usually solved by totally nonlinear time-domain numerical models in two dimensions, and this approach is being extended to three dimensions. The original initial boundary value problem is posed in an unbounded region, extending horizontally up to infinity to model the sea. Its numerical solution requires truncating the domain at a finite distance. Unfortunately, no exact nonreflecting boundary condition on the truncating surface exists in this time-domain formulation. The proposed strategy is based on the coupling of two previously known methods in order to benefit from their different, and complementary, bandwidth: the numerical “beach,” very efficient in the high frequency range; and a piston-like Neumann condition, asymptotically ideal for low frequencies. The coupling method gives excellent results in the whole range of frequencies of interest and is as easy to implement in nonlinear as in linear versions. One of its major advantages is that it does not require any spectral knowledge of the incident waves. },

Our main concern is to properly account for the advection of information as the domain boundary evolves. To achieve this, we use an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework, the distinctive feature being that at each time step results are projected onto a fixed, background mesh, that is where the problem is actually solved.},

The fact that a given free surface implies a known boundary condition on the interface, allows us to solve the Navier–Stokes equations on the fluid domain uncoupled from the solution on the rest of the finite element mesh. This, together with the use of enhanced integration allows us to model low Froude number flows accurately, something that is not possible with typical two-phase flow models applied to free surface flow.

We propose a solution based on enriching the pressure shape functions on the elements cut by the interface. The enrichment is used to enable the pressure gradient to be discontinuous at the interface, thus improving the ability to simulate the behaviour of fluids with different density under a gravitational force. The additional shape function used is local to each element and the corresponding degree of freedom can therefore be condensed prior to assembly, making the implementation quite simple on any existing finite element code.

  Abstract                 = {The simulation of low Froude number mould filling problems on fixed meshes presents significant difficulties. As the Froude number decreases, the coupling between the position of the interface and the resulting flow field increases. The usual two-phase flow model provides poor results for such flow. In order to overcome the difficulties, a free surface model that applies boundary conditions at the interface accurately is used. Moreover, the use of wall laws on curved boundaries also fails in the case of low Froude number flows. To solve this second problem, we combine wall laws with ‘do nothing’ boundary conditions. A special feature of our approach is that ‘do nothing’ boundary conditions are only applied in the normal direction. These two key ingredients together with the Level Set method allow us to simulate three-dimensional mould filling problems borrowed directly from the foundry.

Olsson, G. Kreiss, A conservative level set method for two phase flow, J. Comput. Phys. 210 (2005) 225–246] with a ghost fluid approach. By employing a hyperbolic tangent level set function that is transported and re-initialized using fully conservative numerical schemes, mass conservation issues that are known to affect level set methods are greatly reduced. In order to improve the accuracy of the conservative level set method, high order numerical schemes are used. The overall robustness of the numerical approach is increased by computing the interface normals from a signed distance function reconstructed from the hyperbolic tangent level set by a fast marching method. The convergence of the curvature calculation is ensured by using a least squares reconstruction. The ghost fluid technique provides a way of handling the interfacial forces and large density jumps associated with two-phase flows with good accuracy, while avoiding artificial spreading of the interface. Since the proposed approach relies on partial differential equations, its implementation is straightforward in all coordinate systems, and it benefits from high parallel efficiency. The robustness and efficiency of the approach is further improved by using implicit schemes for the interface transport and re-initialization equations, as well as for the momentum solver. The performance of the method is assessed through both classical level set transport tests and simple two-phase flow examples including topology changes. It is then applied to simulate turbulent atomization of a liquid Diesel jet at Re = 3000 . The conservation errors associated with the accurate conservative level set technique are shown to remain small even for this complex case.},

  Abstract                 = {The application of the single-phase level set approach to the numerical simulations of three-dimensional free surface flows around complex geometries, at both non-breaking and breaking regimes is presented. In this approach only the liquid phase is simulated and the level set function is used as tracking device to locate the free surface position. The extrapolation of the solution in the dummy points in the gaseous phase is such that second-order accuracy is maintained also in the points adjacent to the free surface; the time evolution of the level set function and the re-initialization step have been merged so to get a function which is a distance function everywhere, and satisfies, at the same time, the kinematic condition on the free surface. The implementation of this technique into a general purpose Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations solver developed at \{INSEAN\} [Di Mascio A, Broglia R, Favini B. A Second Order Godunov-type Scheme for Naval Hydrodynamics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers; 2001, p. 253–61], is described in details; capabilities of the algorithm in dealing with non-breaking and breaking flows in the naval hydrodynamic context will be demonstrated by using a submerged hydrofoil and two different ship hulls in straight course as test cases. Comparisons with both experimental data and numerical surface fitting computations are presented; convergence properties of the algorithm, as well as validation and verification assessment will be also discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {In the last two decades, the level set method has been extensively used for the numerical solution of interface problems in different domains. The basic idea is to embed the interface as the level set of a regular function. In this paper we focus on the numerical solution of interface advection equations appearing in free-surface fluid dynamics problems, where naive finite element implementations are unsatisfactory. As a matter of fact, practitioners in fluid dynamics often complain that the mass of each fluid component is not conserved, a phenomenon which is therefore often referred to as mass loss. In this paper we propose and compare two finite element implementations that cure this ill-behaviour without the need to resort to combined strategies (such as e.g. particle level set). The first relies on a discontinuous Galerkin discretization, which is known to give very good performance when facing hyperbolic problems; the second is a stabilized continuous \{FEM\} implementation based on the stabilization method presented in [N. Parolini, Computational fluid dynamics for Naval engineering applications, PhD thesis, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, June 2004], which is free from many of the problems that classical methods exhibit when applied to unsteady problems. },

  Abstract                 = {Orbitally shaken bioreactors are an emerging alternative to stirred-tank bioreactors for large-scale mammalian cell culture, but their fluid dynamics is still not well defined. Among the theoretical and practical issues that remain to be resolved, the characterization of the liquid free surface during orbital shaking remains a major challenge because it is an essential aspect of gas transfer and mixing in these reactors. To simulate the fluid behavior and the free surface shape, we developed a numerical method based on the finite element framework. We found that the large density ratio between the liquid and the gas phases induced unphysical results for the free surface shape. We therefore devised a new pressure correction scheme to deal with large density ratios.The simulations operated with this new scheme gave values of wave amplitude similar to the ones measured experimentally. These simulations were used to calculate the shear stress and to study the mixing principle in orbitally shaken bioreactors. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

As in the 2D case, a reduced version of the Baer–Nunziato model for compressible multiphase flows is used. The physical model is closed by the Tait equation of state for water and can be implemented easily into existing compressible codes based on high resolution shock capturing finite volume schemes. Since the proposed model is fully three-dimensional, it includes the fluid accelerations in gravity direction and hence does not assume a hydrostatic pressure distribution, like the classical shallow water equations. Furthermore, the 3D two-phase model can naturally deal also with breaking waves. To solve the system of conservation laws of mass and momentum coupled with the non-conservative evolution equation of the fluid volume fraction, a high order path-conservative one-step \{WENO\} finite volume scheme is applied, together with a new generalized Osher-type Riemann solver at the element interfaces. The accurate Riemann solver in combination with a high order finite volume approach leads to a simple but sharp resolution of the free surface. A thorough comparison of experimental reference data with the computational results obtained for a large set of three-dimensional test cases shows the suitability of the present approach for the accurate simulation of complex three-dimensional free surface flows. The use of a compressible flow model allows the method to simulate both, low speed and high speed free surface flow problems, which makes the approach applicable to a very wide class of environmental and industrial free surface flow problems.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article we propose a simple and efficient diffuse interface (interface-capturing) two-phase algorithm for the simulation of complex non-hydrostatic free surface flows in general geometries. The physical model is given by a special case of the more general Baer–Nunziato model for compressible multi-phase flows. In the applications considered here, the relative pressure of the gas phase with respect to atmospheric reference conditions is assumed to be zero everywhere and the momentum of the gas phase can be neglected compared to the one of the liquid. The reduced system is closed by the Tait equation of state, which is a widespread model for water. The resulting \{PDE\} system is solved by a high order path-conservative \{WENO\} finite volume scheme on unstructured triangular meshes, to be applicable also in complex geometries. To assure low numerical dissipation at the free surface, which actually is crucial for the applications under consideration here, we use the new generalized Osher-type scheme of Dumbser and Toro [29], which resolves steady shear and contact waves exactly, in contrast to the simpler centered path-conservative \{FORCE\} schemes presented in [26]. The model derives directly from first principles, namely the conservation of mass and momentum, hence it does not make any of the classical simplifications inherent in the commonly used shallow water models, which are based on depth-averaging, neglecting accelerations in gravity directions and on the resulting hydrostatic pressure distribution. We validate the new two-phase model against available analytical, numerical and experimental reference solutions and we also show some comparisons with the classical shallow water model for typical dambreak-type problems. },

  Abstract                 = {When simulating free-surface flows using the finite element method, there are many cases where the governing equations require information which must be derived from the available discretized geometry. Examples are curvature or normal vectors. The accurate computation of this information directly from the finite element mesh often requires a high degree of refinement—which is not necessarily required to obtain an accurate flow solution. As a remedy and an option to be able to use coarser meshes, the representation of the free surface using non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) curves or surfaces is investigated in this work. The advantages of a NURBS parameterization in comparison with the standard approach are discussed. In addition, it is explored how the pressure jump resulting from surface tension effects can be handled using doubled interface nodes. Numerical examples include the computation of surface tension in a two-phase flow as well as the computation of normal vectors as a basis for mesh deformation methods. For these examples, the improvement of the numerical solution compared with the standard approaches on identical meshes is shown. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Free-surface flows occur in several problems in hydrodynamics, such as fuel or water sloshing in tanks, waves breaking in ships, offshore platforms, harbours and coastal areas. The computation of such highly nonlinear flows is challenging since free-surfaces commonly present merging, fragmentation and breaking parts, leading to the use of interface-capturing Eulerian approaches. In such methods the surface between two fluids is captured by the use of a marking function which is transported in a flow field. In this work we present a three-dimensional parallel edge-based incompressible SUPG/PSPG finite element method to cope with free-surface problems with volume-of-fluid (VOF) extensions to track the evolving free surface. The pure advection equation for the scalar marking function was solved by a fully implicit parallel edge-based SUPG finite element formulation. We studied variants of this formulation, considering the effects of discontinuity capturing and a particular tangent transformation designed to increase interface sharpness. Global mass conservation is enforced adding or removing mass proportionally to the absolute value of the normal velocity of the interface. We introduce a parallel dynamic deactivation algorithm to solve the marking function equation only in a small region around the interface. The implementation is targeted to distributed memory systems with cache-based processors. The performance and accuracy of the proposed solution method were tested with several validation problems.

Most of the methods for computing distance fields are devoted to Cartesian grids while little attention has been paid to unstructured grids. Finite element methods are well known for their ability to deal with partial differential equations in unstructured grids. Therefore, we propose an extension of the fast marching method for computing a distance field in a finite element context employing the element interpolation to hold the Eikonal property (∥∇φ∥ = 1). A simple algorithm to develop the computations is also presented and its efficiency demonstrated through various unstructured grid examples. We observed that the presented algorithm has processing times proportional to the number of mesh nodes. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Both the level set method and the particle level set method typically use high order accurate numerical discretizations in time and space, e.g. \{TVD\} Runge–Kutta and HJ-WENO schemes. We demonstrate that these computationally expensive schemes are not required. Instead, fast, low order accurate numerical schemes suffice. That is, the addition of particles to the level set method not only removes the difficulties associated with numerical diffusion, but also alleviates the need for computationally expensive high order accurate schemes. We use an efficient, first order accurate semi-Lagrangian advection scheme coupled with a first order accurate fast marching method to evolve the level set function. To accurately track the underlying flow characteristics, the particles are evolved with a second order accurate method. Since we avoid complex high order accurate numerical methods, extending the algorithm to arbitrary data structures becomes more feasible, and we show preliminary results obtained with an octree-based adaptive mesh. },

The free surface motion and velocity potential are expanded in generalized Fourier series. The derived infinite-dimensional modal system couples generalized time-dependent coordinates of free surface elevation and the velocity potential. The procedure is not restricted by any order of smallness. The general multidimensional structure of the equations is approximated to analyse sloshing in a rectangular tank with finite water depth. The amplitude–frequency response is consistent with the fifth-order steady-state solutions by Waterhouse (1994). The theory is validated by new experimental results. It is shown that transients and associated nonlinear beating are important. An initial variation of excitation periods is more important than initial conditions. The theory is invalid when either the water depth is small or water impacts heavily on the tank ceiling. Alternative expressions for hydrodynamic loads are presented.

  Abstract                 = {Two methodologies for designing an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) time-integrator for the semi-discrete Navier–Stokes equations are reviewed. Each methodology consists of a different mathematical framework for extending to moving grids a numerical scheme originally developed for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) on fixed grids, while preserving its formal order of time-accuracy established on fixed grids. Given a favorite scheme for the solution on fixed grids of the discrete Navier–Stokes equations, each of these two mathematical frameworks can generate multiple \{ALE\} extensions that share the same order of time-accuracy on moving grids. Typically, only a subset of these \{ALE\} schemes satisfy their respective discrete geometric conservation laws (DGCLs). Next, using a nonlinear scalar conservation law (NSCL) as a model problem, it is proved that satisfying the corresponding \{DGCL\} is a necessary condition for any \{ALE\} scheme to preserve on moving grids the nonlinear stability properties of its fixed-grid counterpart. Using the same NSCL, it is also proved that for the \{ALE\} extension of the second-order time-accurate trapezoidal rule, the \{DGCL\} requirement is a necessary as well as sufficient condition for nonlinear stability on moving grids. Hence, each of the two mathematical frameworks described in this paper combined with the \{DGCL\} test provides a general methodology for designing a robust \{ALE\} time-integrator for the solution of unsteady flow problems on dynamic meshes. As an example, the \{ALE\} extension of the popular three-point backward difference scheme is discussed in details. The corresponding theoretical results are illustrated with its application to the solution of various unsteady flow problems arising from the vibrations of the \{AGARD\} Wing 445.6 as well as a complete F-16 configuration in transonic airstreams. },

Although in the last decades the \{SPH\} modelling has been widely used to simulate free-surface flows, few applications have been performed for free-surface channels. For this reason, an appropriate algorithm is developed to enforce different upstream and downstream flow conditions and simulate uniform, non-uniform and unsteady flows. First, the proposed algorithm is validated for a viscous laminar flow in open channel characterized by Reynolds numbers of order O ( 10 2 ) . The second test case deals with a hydraulic jump for which different upstream and downstream conditions are needed. Varying the Froude number, several types of jumps are investigated with specific focus on the velocity field, pressure forces, water depths and location of the jump. Comparisons between numerical results, theory and experimental data are provided. Finally, the interaction between a flash flood generated by an unsteady inflow condition and a bridge is shown as an example of an engineering application. },

  Abstract                 = {While Eulerian schemes work well for most gas flows, they have been shown to admit nonphysical oscillations near some material interfaces. In contrast, Lagrangian schemes work well at multimaterial interfaces, but suffer from their own difficulties in problems with large deformations and vorticity characteristic of most gas flows. We believe that the most robust schemes will combine the best properties of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for treating interfaces in Eulerian schemes that maintains a Heaviside profile of the density with no numerical smearing along the lines of earlier work and most Lagrangian schemes. We use a level set function to track the motion of a multimaterial interface in an Eulerian framework. In addition, the use of ghost cells (actually ghost nodes in our finite difference framework) and a new isobaric fix technique allows us to keep the density profile from smearing out, while still keeping the scheme robust and easy to program with simple extensions to multidimensions and multilevel time integration, e.g., Runge–Kutta methods. In contrast, previous methods used ill-advised dimensional splitting for multidimensional problems and suffered from great complexity when used in conjunction with multilevel time integrators. },

In addition, a linear system of equations for velocity and pressure that provides an alternative approach to the solution of the problem is also derived in this paper. This linear solution scheme can significantly reduce the computational costs in terms of computer \{CPU\} time and memory requirements without the sacrifice of the solution accuracy if the time-step size is sufficiently small. Furthermore, the possibility of adaptively adjusting time-step size is fully exploited. By choosing the volume loss rate as an error indicator, a simple adaptive time-stepping scheme is presented. Finally several numerical examples are provided to assess the performances of the proposed schemes.},

This linear solution strategy is achieved by assuming that the incompressibility condition is enforced although it is relaxed in the GLS formulation. The approach has a distinct advantage over the non-linear Newton–Raphson solution approach in a sense that it can not only significantly reduce the computing costs in terms of computer CPU time and memory requirements but also preserve the solution accuracy if a sufficiently small time-step size is applied. Its applicability is further demonstrated through a wave propagation and breaking problem. For this type of problems, adaptive re-meshing techniques are essential to achieve a successful simulation. A mesh adaptive procedure developed earlier for simulation of large deformation solid mechanics problems is appropriately modified and employed in simulation of flows of incompressible fluids with moving domains.

In contrast, enriched methods, such as the extended finite element method (XFEM), enable the representation of arbitrary jumps and kinks inside elements. Thereby, optimal convergence can be achieved for two-fluid flows with meshes that remain fixed throughout the simulation. In the intrinsic XFEM, in contrast to other enriched methods, no more unknowns are present in the approximation than in a standard finite element approximation. In this work, the intrinsic XFEM is employed for the simulation of incompressible two-fluid flows. Numerical results are shown for a number of test cases and prove the success of the method.

New simulations of atomization processes for air/water conditions are allowing us to investigate the processes leading to the appearance of instabilities in the primary atomization zone in real conditions. For the retracting liquid sheet, the new simulations show that two different regimes can be encountered as a function of the Ohnesorge number. For large values, a laminar flow is encountered inside the rim and a steady state is reached after a quick transient state. For small values, a turbulent flow is generated inside the rim, which is responsible for large oscillations in the rim size and neck thickness. The breaking wave case study demonstrates the orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains of the AMR method.},

The efficiency and accuracy of the technique are demonstrated for two- and three-dimensional flow simulations. For the two-dimensional test example, the results are compared with results obtained using a different tracking approach based on the advection of a passive scalar. Although for both techniques roughly the same structures are found, the resolution for the front tracking technique is much higher. In the three-dimensional test example, a spherical blob is tracked in a chaotic mixing flow. For this problem, the accuracy of the adaptive tracking is demonstrated by the volume conservation for the advected blob. Adaptive front tracking is suitable for simulation of the initial stages of fluid mixing, where the interfacial area can grow exponentially with time. The efficiency of the algorithm significantly benefits from parallelization of the code. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a new stabilized finite element method based on the finite calculus (Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 1998; 151:233–267) and arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian techniques (Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 1998; 155:235–249) for the solution to free surface problems. The main innovation of this method is the application of an overlapping domain decomposition concept in the statement of the problem. The aim is to increase the accuracy in the capture of the free surface as well as in the resolution of the governing equations in the interface between the two fluids. Free surface capturing is based on the solution to a level set equation. The Navier–Stokes equations are solved using an iterative monolithic predictor–corrector algorithm (Encyclopedia of Computational Mechanics. Wiley: New York, 2004), where the correction step is based on imposing the divergence-free condition in the velocity field by means of the solution to a scalar equation for the pressure. Examples of application of the ODDLS formulation (for overlapping domain decomposition level set) to the analysis of different free surface flow problems are presented.

To calculate a variation in a surface variable, a mapping is used in the vertical to shift the problem into a fixed domain. A variation is evaluated in the transformed space from the Jacobian matrix of the mapping. This variation is then mapped back into the original space where it completes a tangent linear model. The adjoint equations are derived using the scalar product formulas redefined for a domain with variable bounds. The method is demonstrated by application to an unsteady fluid flow in a one-dimensional open channel in which horizontal and vertical components of velocity are represented as well as the elevation of the free surface (a 2D vertical section model). This requires the proper treatment of open boundaries in both the forward and adjoint models. A particular application is to the construction of a fully three-dimensional coastal ocean model that allows assimilation of tidal elevation and current data. However, the results are general and can be applied in a wider context. },

Since a possible application is to the construction of a coastal (limited area) circulation model, the open boundary control problem is the main scope of the paper. The assimilation algorithm is built on the limited memory quasi-Newton \{LBFGS\} method guided by the adjoint sensitivities. The analytical step search, which is based on the solution of the tangent linear model, is used. We process the gradients to regularize the solution. In numerical experiments we consider different wave patterns with a purpose to specify a set of incomplete measurements, which could be sufficient for boundary-control identification.

  Abstract                 = {The representation of interfaces by means of the algebraic moving-least-squares (AMLS) technique is addressed. This technique, in which the interface is represented by an unconnected set of points, is interesting for evolving fluid interfaces since there is no surface connectivity. The position of the surface points can thus be updated without concerns about the quality of any surface triangulation. We introduce a novel \{AMLS\} technique especially designed for evolving-interfaces applications that we denote \{RAMLS\} (for Robust AMLS). The main advantages with respect to previous \{AMLS\} techniques are: increased robustness, computational efficiency, and being free of user-tuned parameters. Further, we propose a new front-tracking method based on the Lagrangian advection of the unconnected point set that defines the \{RAMLS\} surface. We assume that a background Eulerian grid is defined with some grid spacing h . The advection of the point set makes the surface evolve in time. The point cloud can be regenerated at any time (in particular, we regenerate it each time step) by intersecting the gridlines with the evolved surface, which guarantees that the density of points on the surface is always well balanced. The intersection algorithm is essentially a ray-tracing algorithm, well-studied in computer graphics, in which a line (ray) is traced so as to detect all intersections with a surface. Also, the tracing of each gridline is independent and can thus be performed in parallel. Several tests are reported assessing first the accuracy of the proposed \{RAMLS\} technique, and then of the front-tracking method based on it. Comparison with previous Eulerian, Lagrangian and hybrid techniques encourage further development of the proposed method for fluid mechanics applications. },

This means that at each time step the geometry of the domain is extracted by employing a particular member of the finite set of shapes described by the nodal cloud. The Lagrangian framework allows us to integrate the inertial terms of the Navier–Stokes equations by employing the method of characteristics which are, precisely, the nodal pathlines.

  Abstract                 = {We consider a standard model for incompressible two-phase flows in which a localized force at the interface describes the effect of surface tension. If a level set (or VOF) method is applied then the interface, which is implicitly given by the zero level of the level set function, is in general not aligned with the triangulation that is used in the discretization of the flow problem. This non-alignment causes severe difficulties w.r.t. the discretization of the localized surface tension force and the discretization of the flow variables. In cases with large surface tension forces the pressure has a large jump across the interface. In standard finite element spaces, due to the non-alignment, the functions are continuous across the interface and thus not appropriate for the approximation of the discontinuous pressure. In many simulations these effects cause large oscillations of the velocity close to the interface, so-called spurious velocities. In this paper, for a simplified model problem, we give an analysis that explains why known (standard) methods for discretization of the localized force term and for discretization of the pressure variable often yield large spurious velocities. In the paper [S. Groß, A. Reusken, Finite element discretization error analysis of a surface tension force in two-phase incompressible flows, Preprint 262, IGPM, \{RWTH\} Aachen, \{SIAM\} J. Numer. Anal. (accepted for publication)], we introduce a new and accurate method for approximation of the surface tension force. In the present paper, we use the extended finite element space (XFEM), presented in [N. Moes, J. Dolbow, T. Belytschko, A finite element method for crack growth without remeshing, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 46 (1999) 131–150; T. Belytschko, N. Moes, S. Usui, C. Parimi, Arbitrary discontinuities in finite elements, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 50 (2001) 993–1013], for the discretization of the pressure. We show that the size of spurious velocities is reduced substantially, provided we use both the new treatment of the surface tension force and the extended pressure finite element space.},

The Navier–Stokes equations are solved in air and water with respect to the real density ratio between the two fluids using a pseudo-compressibility method. The interface tracking is achieved by a new method, called Segment Lagrangian-Volume Of Fluid (SL-VOF), using the well known concepts of VOF, Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC) and adding Lagrangian advection of the segments representing the interface. The verification of this method is made through various simple test cases. Results concerning wave shoaling are compared with those of Boundary Integral Element Method (BIEM) simulations, that are known to be very accurate up to breaking. The SL-VOF method is able to simulate the flow beyond the point at which the interface impacts on itself. Simulations of the breaking stage are compared with experiments. In both cases a very good agreement is observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Mould filling processes, in which a material flow front advances through a mould, are typical examples of moving boundary problems. The moving boundary is accompanied by a moving contact line at the mould walls causing, from a macroscopic modelling viewpoint, a stress singularity. In order to be able to simulate such processes, the moving boundary and moving contact line problem must be overcome. A numerical model for both two- and three-dimensional mould filling simulations has been developed. It employs a pseudo-concentration method in order to avoid elaborate three-dimensional remeshing, and has been implemented in a finite element program. The moving contact line problem has been overcome by employing a Robin boundary condition at the mould walls, which can be turned into a Dirichlet (no-slip) or a Neumann (free-slip) boundary condition depending on the local pseudo-concentration. Simulation results for two-dimensional test cases demonstrate the model's ability to deal with flow phenomena such as fountain flow and flow in bifurcations. The method is by no means limited to two-dimensional flows, as is shown by a pilot simulation for a simple three-dimensional mould. The reverse problem of mould filling is the displacement of a viscous fluid in a tube by a less viscous fluid, which has had considerable attention since the 1960's. Simulation results for this problem are in good agreement with results from the literature. Â© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method of implementing, in two-dimensional (2-D) Navier?Stokes equations, a numerical internal wave generation in the finite volume formulation is developed. To our knowledge, the originality of this model is on the specification of an internal inlet velocity defined as a source line for the generation of linear and non-linear waves. The use of a single cell to represent the source line and its transformation to an internal boundary condition proved to be an interesting alternative to the common procedure of adding a mass source term to the continuity equation within a multi-cell rectangular region. Given the reduction of the source domain to a one-dimensional region, this simple new type of source introduced less perturbation than the 2-D source type. This model was successfully implemented in the \{PHOENICS\} code (Parabolic Hyperbolic Or Elliptic Numerical Integration Code Series). In addition, the volume of fluid (VOF) fraction was used to describe the free surface displacements. A friction force term was added to the momentum transport equation in the vertical direction, in order to enhance wave damping, within relatively limited number of cells representing the sponge layers at the open boundaries. For monochromatic wave, propagating on constant water depth, numerical and analytical results showed good agreements for free surface profiles and vertical distribution of velocity components. For solitary wave simulation, the wave shape and velocity were preserved; while, small discrepancy in the tailing edge of the free surface profiles was observed. The suitability of this new numerical wave generation model for a two source lines extension was investigated and proven to be innovative. The comparisons between numerical, analytical and experimental results showed that the height of the merging waves was correctly reproduced and that the reflected waves do not interact with the source lines.},

The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed advection algorithm, which are analyzed using different tests with prescribed velocity field, compare well with other multidimensional advection methods proposed recently. The algorithm is also applied, in combination with a Navier–Stokes solver, to reproduce the impact of a water droplet falling through air on a pool of deep water. The interfacial curvature is calculated using a height-function technique with adaptive stencil adjustment, which provides improved accuracy in regions of low grid resolution. The comparison of the numerical results with experimental results shows a good degree of agreement. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The Lagrangian description of the level set method is inherently adaptive and exact in the case of solid body motions. The efficiency and accuracy of the method is demonstrated in several benchmark problems in two and three dimensions involving pure advection and curvature induced motion of the interface.

  Abstract                 = {For many problems in ship hydrodynamics, the effects of air flow on the water flow are negligible (the frequently called free surface conditions), but the air flow around the ship is still of interest. A method is presented where the water flow is decoupled from the air solution, but the air flow uses the unsteady water flow as a boundary condition. The authors call this a semi-coupled air/water flow approach. The method can be divided into two steps. At each time step the free surface water flow is computed first with a single-phase method assuming constant pressure and zero stress on the interface. The second step is to compute the air flow assuming the free surface as a moving immersed boundary (IB). The IB method developed for Cartesian grids (Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 2005; 37:239–261) is extended to curvilinear grids, where no-slip and continuity conditions are used to enforce velocity and pressure boundary conditions for the air flow. The forcing points close to the IB can be computed and corrected under a sharp interface condition, which makes the computation very stable. The overset implementation is similar to that of the single-phase solver (Comput. Fluids 2007; 36:1415–1433), with the difference that points in water are set as IB points even if they are fringe points. Pressure–velocity coupling through pressure implicit with splitting of operators or projection methods is used for water computations, and a projection method is used for the air. The method on each fluid is a single-phase method, thus avoiding ill-conditioned numerical systems caused by large differences of fluid properties between air and water. The computation is only slightly slower than the single-phase version, with complete absence of spurious velocity oscillations near the free surface, frequently present in fully coupled approaches. Validations are performed for laminar Couette flow over a wavy boundary by comparing with the analytical solution, and for the surface combatant model David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) 5512 by comparing with Experimental Fluid Dynamics (EFD) and the results of two-phase level set computations. Complex flow computations are demonstrated for the ONR Tumblehome DTMB 5613 with superstructure subject to waves and wind, including 6DOF motions and broaching in SS7 irregular waves and wind.

The proposed method is intended to treat ship hydrodynamics problems. The original level set method for moving interface flows was based on Heaviside functions to smooth all fluid properties across the interface. We call this the Heaviside function method (HFM). The HFM requires fine grids across the interface. The ghost fluid method (GFM) has been designed to explicitly enforce the interfacial jump conditions, but the implementation of the jump conditions in curvilinear grids is intricate. To overcome these difficulties a coupled GFM/HFM method was developed in which approximate jump conditions are derived for piezometric pressure and velocity and pressure gradients based on exact continuous velocity and stress and jump in momentum conditions with the jump in density maintained but continuity of the molecular and turbulent viscosities imposed. The implementation of the ghost points is such that no duplication of memory storage is necessary. The level set method is adopted to locate the air/water interface, and a fast marching method was implemented in curvilinear grids to reinitialize the level set function. Validations are performed for three tests: super- and sub-critical flow without wave breaking and an impulsive plunging wave breaking over 2D submerged bumps, and the flow around surface combatant model DTMB 5512. Comparisons are made against experimental data, HFM and single-phase level set computations. The proposed method performed very well and shows great potential to treat complicated turbulent flows related to ship flows. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

A review of the kinematics and field equations from an arbitrary reference is presented and since the major challenge of the \{ALE\} description lies in the mesh rezoning algorithm, various methods, including a new mixed formulation, are developed to update the mesh and map the moving domain in a more rational manner. Moreover, the streamline-upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation is implemented to accurately describe highly convective free surface flows. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a tsunami problem, the dam-break problem where the Reynolds number is taken as high as 3000, and a large-amplitude sloshing problem.},

  Abstract                 = {A heterogeneous domain decomposition approach is followed to simulate the unsteady wavy flow generated by a body moving beneath a free surface. Attention being focused on complex free surface configurations, including wave-breaking phenomena, a two-fluid viscous flow model is used in the free surface region to capture the air–water interface (via a level-set technique), while a potential flow approximation is adopted to describe the flow far from the interface. Two coupling strategies are investigated, differing in the transmission conditions. Both the adopted approaches make use of the inviscid velocity field as boundary condition in the Navier–Stokes solution.For validation purposes, two different two-dimensional non-breaking flows are simulated. Domain decomposition results are compared with both fully viscous and fully inviscid results, obtained by solving the corresponding equations in the whole fluid domain, and with available experimental data. Finally, the unsteady evolution of a steep breaking wave is followed and some of the physical phenomena, experimentally observed, are reproduced. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {An unsteady Navier–Stokes solver for incompressible fluid is coupled with a level set approach to describe free surface motions. The two-phase flow of air and water is approximated by the flow of a single fluid whose properties, such as density and viscosity, change across the interface. The free surface location is captured as the zero level of a distance function convected by the flow field. To validate the numerical procedure, two classical two-dimensional free surface problems in hydrodynamics, namely the oscillating flow in a tank and the waves generated by the flow over a bottom bump, are studied in non-breaking conditions, and the results are compared with those obtained with other numerical approaches. To check the capability of the method in dealing with complex free surface configurations, the breaking regime produced by the flow over a high bump is analyzed. The analysis covers the successive stages of the breaking phenomenon: the steep wave evolution, the falling jet, the splash-up and the air entrainment. In all phases, numerical results qualitatively agree with the experimental observations. Finally, to investigate a flow in which viscous effects are relevant, the numerical scheme is applied to study the wavy flow past a submerged hydrofoil. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for tracking evolving interfaces by lagrangian particles in conjunction with a Level-Set approach is introduced. This numerical technique is based on the use of time evolution equations for fundamental vector and tensor quantities defined on the front and represents a new and convenient way to couple the advantages of the Eulerian description given by a Level-Set function ϕ to the use of Lagrangian massless particles. The term oriented points out that the information advected by the particles not only concern the spatial location, but also the local (outward) normal vector n to the interface Γ and the second fundamental tensor (the shape operator) ∇ n . The particles are exactly located upon Γ and provide all the requested information for tracking the interface on their own. In addition, a self-adaptive mechanism suitably modifies, at each time step, the markers distribution in the numerical domain: each particle behaves both as a potential seeder of new markers on Γ (so as to guarantee an accurate reconstruction of the interface) and a de-seeder (to avoid any useless gathering of markers and to limit the computational effort). The algorithm is conceived to avoid any transport equation for ϕ and to confine the Level-Set function to the role of a mere post-processing tool; thus, all the numerical diffusion problems usually affecting the Level-Set methodology are removed. The method has been tested both on 2D and 3D configurations; it carries out a fast reconstruction of the interface and its accuracy is only limited by the spatial resolution of the mesh.},

To evaluate the external applied forces on each particle, the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using a Lagrangian formulation are solved at each time step. The interpolation functions are those used in the Meshless Finite Element Method and the time integration is introduced by an implicit fractional-step method. In this manner classical stabilization terms used in the momentum equations are unnecessary due to lack of convective terms in the Lagrangian formulation.

By using the marker surface regeneration technique, the marker surface including a great number of marker elements is recreated on the basis of its original shape in order to decrease the number of marker elements and computational time. A3-D example used as the benchmark test and a typical industrial problem of the die-casting process have been analysed. The numerical results have been in good agreement with the experimental results and the efficiency of the adaptive grid refinement technique has been verified. It has been shown that the proposed techniques incorporated in the marker surface method and the adaptive grid refinement technique can be effectively applied to general industrial problems.

  Abstract                 = {Under a generalized coordinate transformation with arbitrary grid velocity, the gas-kinetic \{BGK\} equation is reformulated in a moving frame of reference. Then, a unified conservative gas-kinetic scheme is developed for the viscous flow computation in the moving grid system in the Eulerian space. Due to the coupling between the grid velocity and the overall solution algorithm, the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods become two limiting cases in the current gas-kinetic method. A fully conservative formulation can be obtained even in the Lagrangian limit. The moving grid method extends the applicable regime of the gas-kinetic scheme to the flows with free surface or moving boundaries, such as dam break problem and airfoil oscillations. In order to further increase the robustness of the moving grid method, similar to the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method, a conservative adaptive grid technique is also implemented in the current method to redistribute the mesh concentration to the rapid variational flow region and remedy the distorted moving mesh due to the coupling between grid velocity and fluid speed. Many numerical examples from incompressible flow to the supersonic shock interaction are presented. The test cases verify the accuracy and robustness of the unified moving grid gas-kinetic method.},

In these mesh update strategies, based on the special and automatic mesh moving schemes, the frequency of remeshing is minimized to reduce the projection errors and to minimize the cost associated with mesh generation and parallelization set-up.

The model solves the three-dimensional, incompressible, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and continuity equations in generalized curvilinear coordinates using a fractional step method extended to handle multiphase flows. Turbulence is modeled by a two-equation \{RANS\} model implemented in the context of the \{CURVIB\} method. The accuracy of the level set method is verified by applying it to simulate two- and three-dimensional sloshing problems, and the potential of the model for simulating real life, turbulent free surface flows is demonstrated by applying it to carry out \{RANS\} simulation of flow past rock structures in a laboratory flume and flow in a field scale meandering channel. The simulations show that the method is able to accurately predict water surface elevation over complex hydraulic structures and bathymetry, and capture the transition between subcritical and supercritical flows without any special treatment. },

  Abstract                 = {Interactions between surface waves and underlying viscous wake are investigated for a turbulent flow past a free surface piercing circular cylinder at Reynolds number Re=2.7×104 using large eddy simulation (LES). The computations have been performed for three Froude numbers Fr=0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 in order to examine the influence of the Froude number. A second-order finite volume method coupled with a fractional step method is used for solving the grid-filtered incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The computational results are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental data. At low Froude numbers Fr=0.2 and 0.5, the amplitude of generated surface wave is small and the influence on the wake is not evident. On the other hand, strong wave-wake interactions are present at Fr=0.8, when the generated free surface wave is very steep. It is shown that structures of the underlying vortical flow correlate closely with the configuration of the free surface. Computational results show presence of a recirculation zone starting at the point where the surface slope changes discontinuously. Above this zone the surface elevation fluctuates intensively. The computed intensity of the surface fluctuation is in good agreement with the measurements. It is also shown that the periodic vortex shedding is attenuated near the free surface at a high Froude number. The region in which the periodic vortex shedding is hampered extends to about one diameter from the mean water level. It is qualitatively shown that the separated shear layers are inclined outward near the free surface due to the generation of the surface waves. This change in the relation between two shear layers is suggested to be responsible for the attenuation of the periodic vortex shedding.},

Furthermore, the approach builds on standard level set tools and can therefore be used to augment existing implementations of level set methods with discrete conservation properties.

Linear and quadratic approximations on unstructured tetrahedral and trilinear approximations on hexahedral meshes were tested.

An adaptive (Lagrangian) boundary-element approach is proposed for the general three-dimensional simulation of confined free-surface flow of viscous incompressible fluids. The method is stable as it includes remeshing capabilities of the deforming free-surface, and thus can handle large deformations. A simple algorithm is developed for mesh refinement of the deforming free-surface mesh. Smooth transition between large and small elements is achieved without significant degradation of the aspect ratio of the elements in the mesh. The method is used to determine the flow field and free-surface evolution inside cubic, rectangular and cylindrical containers. These problems illustrate the transient nature of the flow during the mixing process. Surface tension effects are also explored. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

For the free surface flow, a volume of fluid (VOF)-based algorithm utilizing a fixed grid system has been investigated. In order to reduce numerical smearing at the free surface represented on a fixed grid system, a new free surface-tracking algorithm based on the donor–acceptor scheme has been proposed. Novel features of the proposed algorithm are characterized by two numerical tools; the orientation vector to represent the free surface orientation in each cell and the baby-cell to determine the fluid volume flux at each cell boundary. The proposed algorithm can be easily implemented in any irregular non-uniform grid systems usually encountered in the finite element method (FEM). Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended and applied to the 3D free surface flow problems without additional efforts. For computation of unsteady incompressible flow, a finite element approximation based on the explicit fractional step method has been adopted. In addition, the streamline upwind/Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method has been implemented to deal with convection dominated flows. Combination of the proposed free surface-tracking scheme and the explicit fractional step formulation resulted in an efficient solution algorithm. Validity of the present solution algorithm was demonstrated from its application to the broken dam and the solitary wave propagation problems. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The numerical method is based on the Navier–Stokes equations that describe the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid. The equations are discretised on a fixed Cartesian grid using the finite volume method. Even though very small cut cells can appear when moving an object through the fixed grid, the method is stable. The free surface is displaced using the Volume-of-Fluid method together with a local height function, resulting in a strictly mass conserving method. The choice of boundary conditions at the free surface appears to be crucial for the accuracy and robustness of the method. For validation, results of a dambreak simulation are shown that can be compared with measurements. A box has been placed in the flow, as a model for a container on the deck of an offshore floater on which forces are calculated. The water entry problem has been investigated by dropping wedges with different dead-rise angles, a cylinder and a cone into calm water with a prescribed velocity. The resulting free surface dynamics, with the sideways jets, has been compared with photographs of experiments. Also a comparison of slamming coefficients with theory and experimental results has been made. Finally, a drop test with a free falling wedge has been simulated.},

  Abstract                 = {A three-dimensional numerical model is developed for incompressible free surface flows. The model is based on the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with a non-hydrostatic pressure distribution being incorporated in the model. The governing equations are solved in the conventional sigma co-ordinate system, with a semi-implicit time discretization. A fractional step method is used to enable the pressure to be decomposed into its hydrostatic and hydrodynamic components. At every time step one five-diagonal system of equations is solved to compute the water elevations and then the hydrodynamic pressure is determined from a pressure Poisson equation. The model is applied to three examples to simulate unsteady free surface flows where non-hydrostatic pressures have a considerable effect on the velocity field. Emphasis is focused on applying the model to wave problems. Two of the examples are about modelling small amplitude waves where the hydrostatic approximation and long wave theory are not valid. The other example is the wind-induced circulation in a closed basin. The numerical solutions are compared with the available analytical solutions for small amplitude wave theory and very good agreement is obtained. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel numerical scheme is developed by coupling the level set method with the adaptive mesh refinement in order to analyse moving interfaces economically and accurately. The finite element method (FEM) is used to discretize the governing equations with the generalized simplified marker and cell (GSMAC) scheme, and the cubic interpolated pseudo-particle (CIP) method is applied to the reinitialization of the level set function. The present adaptive mesh refinement is implemented in the quadrangular grid systems and easily embedded in the FEM-based algorithm. For the judgement on renewal of mesh, the level set function is adopted as an indicator, and the threshold is set at the boundary of the smoothing band. With this criterion, the variation of physical properties and the jump quantity on the free surface can be calculated accurately enough, while the computation cost is largely reduced as a whole. In order to prove the validity of the present scheme, two-dimensional numerical simulation is carried out in collapse of a water column, oscillation and movement of a drop under zero gravity. As a result, its effectiveness and usefulness are clearly shown qualitatively and quantitatively. Among them, the movement of a drop due to the Marangoni effect is first simulated efficiently with the present scheme. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = { Three-dimensional dynamic gas–liquid flow simulations that accurately track the phase interface are numerically challenging. This article presents a numerical study of the performance of the level-set phase–interface tracking method when combined with extremely high order (7th to 11th) weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) advection schemes for gas–liquid free surface flows. Comparisons between simulation results and prior benchmark results suggest that such a combination of methods can be satisfactorily applied to the level-set and Navier-Stokes equations for free surface flow simulations when volume conservation is enforced at every time step, and minor numerical oscillations are suppressed through use of an artificial viscosity term. In particular, simulations of solid body rotation, the unsteady flow following an ideal dam break, tank sloshing, and the rise of a single bubble all agree with analytical or experimental results to within ± 3.12% when the level-set method is combined with an 11th order WENO scheme. Furthermore, use of an 11th order WENO advection scheme actually has a computational cost advantage because, for the same accuracy, it can be used on a coarser grid when compared with a more-common second-order advection scheme; computational savings of up to 87% are possible. },

A PDE-constrained optimization problem is formulated and solved in an iterative fashion. The proposed optimal control procedure constrains the level set function to satisfy a conservation law for the corresponding Heaviside function. The target value of the state variable is defined as the solution to the standard level set transport equation. The gradient of the control variable corrects the convective flux in the nonlinear state equation so as to enforce mass conservation while minimizing deviations from the target state. A relaxation term is added when it comes to the design of an iterative solver for the nonlinear system. The potential of the optimization-based approach is illustrated by two numerical examples. },

  Abstract                 = {In this work, a technique for simultaneous untangling and smoothing of meshes is presented. It is based on an extension of an earlier mesh smoothing strategy developed to solve the computational mesh dynamics stage in fluid–structure interaction problems. In moving grid problems, mesh untangling is necessary when element inversion happens as a result of a moving domain boundary. The smoothing strategy, formerly published by the authors, is defined in terms of the minimization of a functional associated with the mesh distortion by using a geometric indicator of the element quality. This functional becomes discontinuous when an element has null volume, making it impossible to obtain a valid mesh from an invalid one. To circumvent this drawback, the functional proposed is transformed in order to guarantee its continuity for the whole space of nodal coordinates, thus achieving the untangling technique. This regularization depends on one parameter, making the recovery of the original functional possible as this parameter tends to 0. This feature is very important: consequently, it is necessary to regularize the functional in order to make the mesh valid; then, it is advisable to use the original functional to make the smoothing optimal. Finally, the simultaneous untangling and smoothing technique is applied to several test cases, including 2D and 3D meshes with simplicial elements. As an additional example, the application of this technique to a mesh generation case is presented. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Mesh motion strategy is one of the key points in many fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems. Due to the increasing application of FSI to solve the current challenging engineering problems, this topic has become of great interest. There are several different strategies to solve this problem, some of them use a discrete and lumped spring–mass system to propagate the boundary motion into the volume mesh, and many others use an elastostatic problem to deform the mesh. In all these strategies there is always risk of producing an invalid mesh, i.e. a mesh with some elements inverted. Normally this condition is irreversible and once an invalid mesh is obtained it is difficult to continue.In this paper the mesh motion strategy is defined as an optimization problem. By its definition this strategy can be classified as a particular case of an elastostatic problem where the material constitutive law is defined in terms of the minimization of certain energy functional that takes into account the degree of element distortion. Some advantages of this strategy are its natural tendency to high quality meshes, its robustness and its straightforward extension to 3D problems. Several examples included in this paper show these capabilities.Even though this strategy seems to be very robust it is not able to recover a valid mesh starting from an invalid one. This improvement is left for future work. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The method is based on using markers that are placed every time step at the mid-points of the reconstructed cell interface segments. The markers are used to improve the orientation and location of the interface segments, although the method essentially remains of a \{VOF\} type. Numerical tests show that a substantial improvement in accuracy is achieved over previous volume of fluid methods, and that the proposed method compares well even with a recent hybrid markers and volume of fluid method.},

  Abstract                 = {A volume of fluid (VOF) technique has been developed and coupled with an incompressible Euler/Navier–Stokes solver operating on adaptive, unstructured grids to simulate the interactions of extreme waves and three-dimensional structures. The present implementation follows the classic \{VOF\} implementation for the liquid–gas system, considering only the liquid phase. Extrapolation algorithms to obtain velocities and pressure in the gas region near the free surface have been implemented. The \{VOF\} technique is validated against the classic dam-break problem, as well as series of 2D sloshing experiments and results from smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations. These and a series of other examples demonstrate that the present \{CFD\} method is capable of simulating violent free surface flows with strong nonlinear behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {A recently developed stabilised finite element method which draws upon features of both continuous and discontinuous finite element methods is generalised for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on moving domains and for free surface problems. The approach allows the natural incorporation of upwinding of the advective flux, and the formulation is stable when using equal-order Lagrange basis functions for the velocity and pressure fields. Particular attention is paid to the formulation of a fractional step algorithm for moving domain problems. Numerous applications to environmental free surface flows are presented, ranging from simple test cases to simulations of sophisticated laboratory experiments. It is shown that the formulation, which contains no flow-dependent stabilisation parameters, is able to model a wide range of flow conditions stably without user intervention, and it is shown that negligible numerical dissipation is introduced. The physics of the considered numerical examples involves sensitive free surface wave behaviour, which has been accurately captured due to the stability of the model together with negligible introduced numerical dissipation. },

The method is shown to be less restrictive in terms of \{CFL\} conditions than split Volume-of-Fluid methods. Various geometric integration schemes are proposed and tested. For linear velocity fields, mass error is shown to vanish, and to be third order otherwise. The method is validated on 2D and 3D test cases. Conservation properties are shown to be excellent, while geometrical accuracy remains satisfactory even for complex flows such as the primary breakup of a liquid jet. },

The proposed method is conceptually simple and free of user-defined parameters. Starting with a conforming finite element mesh, the key ingredient is to switch those elements intersected by the Dirichlet boundary to a discontinuous-Galerkin approximation and impose the Dirichlet boundary conditions strongly. By virtue of relaxing the continuity constraint at those elements, boundary locking is avoided and optimal-order convergence is achieved.

  Abstract                 = {A coupled Lagrangian interface-tracking and Eulerian level set (LS) method is developed and implemented for numerical simulations of two-fluid flows. In this method, the interface is identified based on the locations of notional particles and the geometrical information concerning the interface and fluid properties, such as density and viscosity, are obtained from the LS function. The LS function maintains a signed distance function without an auxiliary equation via the particle-based Lagrangian re-initialization technique. To assess the new hybrid method, numerical simulations of several ‘standard interface-moving’ problems and two-fluid laminar and turbulent flows are conducted. The numerical results are evaluated by monitoring the mass conservation, the turbulence energy spectral density function and the consistency between Eulerian and Lagrangian components. The results of our analysis indicate that the hybrid particle-level set method can handle interfaces with complex shape change, and can accurately predict the interface values without any significant (unphysical) mass loss or gain, even in a turbulent flow. The results obtained for isotropic turbulence by the new particle-level set method are validated by comparison with those obtained by the ‘zero Mach number’, variable-density method. For the cases with small thermal/mass diffusivity, both methods are found to generate similar results. Analysis of the vorticity and energy equations indicates that the destabilization effect of turbulence and the stability effect of surface tension on the interface motion are strongly dependent on the density and viscosity ratios of the fluids.

Good results are obtained even when the amplitude of water oscillation rises near to 100% of the original depth of the stationary water.

J Comput Phys 1994;114:146–59] on coupling the level set method of [Osher S, Sethian J. Fronts propagating with curvature-dependent speed: algorithms based on Hamilton–Jacobi formulations. J Comput Phys 1988;79:12–49] to the equations for two-phase incompressible flow, there has been a great deal of interest in this area. That work demonstrated the most powerful aspects of the level set method, i.e. automatic handling of topological changes such as merging and pinching, as well as robust geometric information such as normals and curvature. Interestingly, this work also demonstrated the largest weakness of the level set method, i.e. mass or information loss characteristic of most Eulerian capturing techniques. In fact, [Sussman M, Smereka P, Osher S. A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow. J Comput Phys 1994;114:146–59] introduced a partial differential equation for battling this weakness, without which their work would not have been possible. In this paper, we discuss both historical and most recent works focused on improving the computational accuracy of the level set method focusing in part on applications related to incompressible flow due to both of its popularity and stringent accuracy requirements. Thus, we discuss higher order accurate numerical methods such as Hamilton–Jacobi \{WENO\} [Jiang G-S, Peng D.

  Abstract                 = {We present a new three-dimensional hybrid level set (LS) and volume of fluid (VOF) method for free surface flow simulations on tetrahedral grids. At each time step, we evolve both the level set function and the volume fraction. The level set function is evolved by solving the level set advection equation using a second-order characteristic based finite volume method. The volume fraction advection is performed using a bounded compressive normalized variable diagram (NVD) based scheme. The interface is reconstructed based on both the level set and the volume fraction information. The novelty of the method lies in that we use an analytic method for finding the intercepts on tetrahedral grids, which makes interface reconstruction efficient and conserves volume of fluid exactly. Furthermore, the advection of volume fraction makes use of the \{NVD\} concept and switches between different high resolution differencing schemes to yield a bounded scalar field, and to preserve both smoothness and sharp definition of the interface. The method is coupled to a well validated finite volume based Navier–Stokes incompressible flow solver. The code validation shows that our method can be employed to resolve complex interface changes efficiently and accurately. In addition, the centroid and intercept data available as a by-product of the proposed interface reconstruction scheme can be used directly in near-interface sub-grid models in large eddy simulation. },

It is based on the use of a meshless technique coined as natural element method (NEM) or, more recently, as natural neighbour Galerkin method. The position of the flow front or the geometry of the fluid domain is handled by invoking the geometrical concept of α-shape of the cloud of points, thus avoiding the explicit definition of the boundary of the domain as it evolves. This method also avoids the traditional need of remeshing typical in finite element simulations of this kind of processes. Three types of fluid behaviour have been considered, namely a purely Newtonian fluid, a non-Newtonian short fibre-reinforced thermoplastic, and finally a Norton–Hoff viscoplastic behaviour. Benchmark examples showing the performance of the technique are included in the paper. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

After discretization, the spines hi (α, ti) subdivide the liquid zone into conical subvolumes. The volume of each of the subvolumes is updated using the local velocities at the interface of every two neighboring subvolumes. A technique is developed to calculate the new spines based on the updated subvolumes. The method is referred to as the spine-flux method (SFM) and it is implemented in a Galerkin finite element method with penalty formulation.

This technique combines the strength on the finite element method (FEM) in calculating the field variables for a deforming boundary and the versatility of the volume-of-fluid (VOF) technique in advection of the fluid interfaces. The advantage of the VOF technique is that it allows the simulation of interfaces with large deformations, including surface merging and breaking. However, its disadantage is that is solving the flow equations, it cannot resolve interfaces smaller than the cell size, since information on the subgrid scale is lost. Therefore the accuracy of the interface reconstruction and the treatment of the boundary conditions (i.e. viscous stresses and surface tension forces) become grid-size-dependent. On the other hand, the FEM with deforming interface mesh allows accurate implementation of the boundary conditions, but it cannot handle large surface deformations occurring in breaking and merging of liquid regions. Combining the two methods into a hybrid FEM-VOF method eliminates the major shortcomings of both. The outcome is a technique which can handle large surface deformations with accurate treatment of the boundary conditions. For illustration, two computational examples are presented, namely the instability and break-up of a capillary jet and the coalescence collision of two liquid drops.},

The \{MAC\} technique dates back to the early 1960s at the Los Alamos Laboratories and this article starts with a historical review, and then a brief discussion of related techniques. Improvements since the early days of \{MAC\} (and the Simplified \{MAC\} – SMAC) include automatic time-stepping, the use of the conjugate gradient method to solve the Poisson equation for the corrected velocity potential, greater efficiency through stripping out the virtual particles (markers) other than those near the free surface, and more accurate approximations of the free surface boundary conditions, the addition of bounded high accuracy upwinding for the convected terms (thereby being able to solve higher Reynolds number flows), and a (dynamics) flow visualization facility. More recently, effective techniques for surface and interfacial flows and, in particular, for accurately tracking the associated surface(s)/interface(s) including moving contact angles have been developed. This article will concentrate principally on a three-dimensional version of the \{SMAC\} method. It will eschew both code verification and model validation; instead it will emphasize the applications that the \{MAC\} method can solve, from multiphase flows to rheology. },

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates the numerical simulation of three-dimensional time-dependent viscoelastic free surface flows using the Upper-Convected Maxwell (UCM) constitutive equation and an algebraic explicit model. This investigation was carried out to develop a simplified approach that can be applied to the extrudate swell problem. The relevant physics of this flow phenomenon is discussed in the paper and an algebraic model to predict the extrudate swell problem is presented. It is based on an explicit algebraic representation of the non-Newtonian extra-stress through a kinematic tensor formed with the scaled dyadic product of the velocity field. The elasticity of the fluid is governed by a single transport equation for a scalar quantity which has dimension of strain rate. Mass and momentum conservations, and the constitutive equation (UCM and algebraic model) were solved by a three-dimensional time-dependent finite difference method. The free surface of the fluid was modeled using a marker-and-cell approach. The algebraic model was validated by comparing the numerical predictions with analytic solutions for pipe flow. In comparison with the classical \{UCM\} model, one advantage of this approach is that computational workload is substantially reduced: the \{UCM\} model employs six differential equations while the algebraic model uses only one. The results showed stable flows with very large extrudate growths beyond those usually obtained with standard differential viscoelastic models.},

  Abstract                 = {The level set method is becoming increasingly popular for the simulation of several problems that involve interfaces. The level set function is advected by some velocity field, with the zero-level set of the function defining the position of the interface. The advection distorts the initial shape of the level set function, which needs to be re-initialized to a smooth function preserving the position of the zero-level set. Many algorithms re-initialize the level set function to (some approximation of) the signed distance from the interface. Efficient algorithms for level set redistancing on Cartesian meshes have become available over the last years, but unstructured meshes have received little attention. This presentation concerns algorithms for construction of a distance function from the zero-level set, in such a way that mass is conserved on arbitrary unstructured meshes. The algorithm is consistent with the hyperbolic character of the distance equation (‖∇d‖=1) and can be localized on a narrow band close to the interface, saving computing effort. The mass-correction step is weighted according to local mass differences, an improvement over usual global rebalancing techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {The extended finite element method (X-FEM), in conjunction with the level set method, is applied to sloshing analysis of a rigid container filled with liquid. The governing equations for liquid with a free surface based on the potential flow theory are discretized using the framework of level set X-FEM. Once the space domain of a container is modeled by tetrahedral elements, sloshing analysis for arbitrary liquid levels and configurations can be performed without remeshing. Natural frequencies of free surface sloshing motion in rigid containers of various shapes were computed by the proposed method and the results were compared with those obtained by theoretical solutions and experiments. The proposed method was demonstrated to perform sloshing analysis efficiently for rigid containers with various liquid levels and configurations. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {A conservative method of level set type for moving interfaces in divergence free velocity fields is presented. The interface is represented implicitly by the 0.5 level set of a function Φ being a smeared out Heaviside function, i.e., a function being zero on one side of the interface and one on the other. In a transition layer of finite, constant thickness Φ goes smoothly from zero to one. The interface is moved implicitly by the advection of Φ, which is split into two steps. First Φ is advected using a standard numerical method. Then an intermediate step is performed to make sure that the smooth profile of Φ and the thickness of the transition layer is preserved. Both these steps are performed using conservative second order approximations and thus conserving ∫Φ. In this way good conservation of the area bounded by the 0.5 contour of Φ is obtained. Numerical tests shows up to second order accuracy and very good conservation of the area bounded by the interface. The method was also coupled to a Navier–Stokes solver for incompressible two phase flow with surface tension. Results with and without topological changes are presented. },

Phys.79, 12–49) as a simple and versatile method for computing and analyzing the motion of an interface Γ in two or three dimensions. Γ bounds a (possibly multiply connected) region Ω. The goal is to compute and analyze the subsequent motion of Γ under a velocity field v. This velocity can depend on position, time, the geometry of the interface, and the external physics. The interface is captured for later time as the zero level set of a smooth (at least Lipschitz continuous) function ϕ (x, t); i.e., Γ(t)={x|ϕ(x, t)=0}. ϕ is positive inside Ω, negative outside Ω, and is zero on Γ(t). Topological merging and breaking are well defined and easily performed. In this review article we discuss recent variants and extensions, including the motion of curves in three dimensions, the dynamic surface extension method, fast methods for steady state problems, diffusion generated motion, and the variational level set approach. We also give a user's guide to the level set dictionary and technology and couple the method to a wide variety of problems involving external physics, such as compressible and incompressible (possibly reacting) flow, Stefan problems, kinetic crystal growth, epitaxial growth of thin films, vortex-dominated flows, and extensions to multiphase motion. We conclude with a discussion of applications to computer vision and image processing.},

These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

Pitsch, An accurate conservative level set/ghost fluid method for simulating turbulent atomization, J. Comput. Phys. 227 (18) (2008) 8395–8416] is extended by using a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization. \{DG\} allows for the scheme to have an arbitrarily high order of accuracy with the smallest possible computational stencil resulting in an accurate method with good parallel scaling. This work includes a \{DG\} implementation of the level set transport equation, which moves the level set with the flow field velocity, and a \{DG\} implementation of the reinitialization equation, which is used to maintain the shape of the level set profile to promote good mass conservation. A near second order converging interface curvature is obtained by following a height function methodology (common amongst volume of fluid schemes) in the context of the conservative level set. Various numerical experiments are conducted to test the properties of the method and show excellent results, even on coarse meshes. The tests include Zalesak’s disk, two-dimensional deformation of a circle, time evolution of a standing wave, and a study of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. Finally, this novel methodology is employed to simulate the break-up of a turbulent liquid jet. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a hybrid volume-of-fluid (VOF) level-set method for simulating incompressible two-phase flows. Motion of the free surface is represented by a VOF algorithm that uses high resolution differencing schemes to algebraically preserve both the sharpness of interface and the boundedness of volume fraction. The VOF method is specifically based on a simple order high resolution scheme lower than that of a comparable method, but still leading to a nearly equivalent order of accuracy. Retaining the mass conservation property, the hybrid algorithm couples the proposed VOF method with a level-set distancing algorithm in an implicit manner when the normal and the curvature of the interface need to be accurate for consideration of surface tension. For practical purposes, it is developed to be efficiently and easily extensible to three-dimensional applications with a minor implementation complexity. The accuracy and convergence properties of the method are verified through a wide range of tests: advection of rigid interfaces of different shapes, a three-dimensional air bubble's rising in viscous liquids, a two-dimensional dam-break, and a three-dimensional dam-break over an obstacle mounted on the bottom of a tank. The standard advection tests show that the volume advection algorithm is comparable in accuracy with geometric interface reconstruction algorithms of higher accuracy than other interface capturing-based methods found in the literature. The numerical results for the remainder of tests show a good agreement with other numerical solutions or available experimental data. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Attention is paid to mass-conservation and integrity of the interface.The proposed computational method is a Level-Set method, where a Volume-of-Fluid function is used to conserve mass when the interface is advected. The aim of the method is to combine the advantages of the Level-Set and Volume-of-Fluid methods without the disadvantages. The flow is computed with a pressure correction method with the Marker-and-Cell scheme. Interface conditions are satisfied by means of the continuous surface force methodology and the jump in the density field is maintained similar to the ghost fluid method for incompressible flows.

The standard way to enforce this type of boundary condition is described, followed by an adaptation of the one we proposed in [36] that provides higher pressure and velocity convergence rates in space and time for pressure-correction schemes. These two methods are illustrated with a numerical test with both finite volume and spectral Legendre methods. We conclude with three physical simulations: first with the flow over a backward-facing step, secondly, we study, in a geometry where a bifurcation takes place, the influence of Reynolds number on the laminar flow structure, and lastly, we verify the solution obtained for the unsteady flow around a square cylinder.},

On one hand, the algorithm used to solve the Navier–Stokes equations provides the neccessary stabilization for using the efficient and accurate three-node triangles for both the velocity and pressure fields. On the other hand, the interface position is described by the zero-level set of an indicator function. To maintain accuracy, even for large-density ratios, the pseudoconcentration function is corrected at the end of each time step using an algorithm successfully used in the finite difference context. Coupling of both problems is solved in a staggered way. As demonstrated by the solution of a number of numerical tests, the procedure allows dealing with problems involving two interacting fluids with a large-density ratio.

The first method solves the Navier–Stokes equations considering two immiscible and incompressible fluids, assigning the density and viscosity according to an indicator function whose zero level set determines the interface position. The second method is based on solving the Shallow Water equations using the well known Two-Step Taylor–Galerkin method. In this case, the problem becomes one of a drying and wetting one. This problem is simply handled by assigning null depth and velocity of the calculated dry nodes when performing the integrals over the elements in the mesh. The comparison of the results from the two methods for a number of test cases reveals the shortcomings of the Shallow Water approach. However, when considering the computational effort required by each method, the Shallow Water approach should be considered as a major candidate for computations involving large domains, leaving the Navier–Stokes approach for fine calculations where knowledge of the 3D structure of the flow is required. },

The approach furnishes, in effect, a Lagrangian implementation of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. As the flow proceeds, the mesh is maintained undistorted through continuous and adaptive remeshing of the fluid mass. The principal advantage of the present approach lies in the treatment of boundary conditions at material surfaces such as free boundaries, fluid/fluid or fluid/solid interfaces. In contrast to Eulerian approaches, boundary conditions are enforced at material surfaces ab initio and therefore require no special attention. Consistent tangents are obtained for Lagrangian implicit analysis of a Newtonian fluid flow which may exhibit compressibility effects. The accuracy of the approach is assessed by comparison of the solution for a sloshing problem with existing numerical results and its versatility demonstrated through a simulation of wave breaking.

  Abstract                 = {There exists a sharp density jump at the fluid interfaces in most of interfacial flows encountered in engineering applications. Numerical treatment of the discontinuous fluid density in such flows is a great challenge. In particular, numerical errors can lead to non-physical results at large density ratios, hence limit a flow solver to only small and usually unrealistic density ratios. We introduce a consistent mass and momentum transport method which allows for simulations of interfacial flows with large density ratios in the context of the level set method. Fluid momentum is transported by discretizing the conservative form of the convective term in the momentum equation. A new technique is introduced to compute the flux density based on the temporal evolution of the fluid interfaces and by using the level set function at two subsequent time levels. For consistency, we use the same flux density for both mass and momentum transport, and thereby establish a tight coupling between them. We assess the performance of the proposed method by using a set of benchmark test cases, in which the density ratio ranges from 650 to 106. The new method is stable and accurate even at extreme density ratios. The numerical results agree very well with the theoretical and experimental results. In contrast, the results of a non-conservative formulation show non-physical fluid behavior, where the dense fluid is slowed down by the light fluid due to numerical errors. },

The phase interface is resolved by using a modified donor-acceptor differencing technique for computing mass transport. Inaccuracies resulting from slightly inconsistent calculations of mass and energy transport are avoided by converting the energy equation into a form which does not involve a convective derivative. A nonconservative form of the momentum equation is utilized because velocity is typically a smoother function than momentum density when the phase density ratio is large.

  Abstract                 = {A new algorithm for the volume tracking of interfaces in two dimensions is presented. The algorithm is based upon a well-defined, second-order geometric solution of a volume evolution equation. The method utilizes local discrete material volume and velocity data to track interfaces of arbitrarily complex topology. A linearity-preserving, piecewise linear interface geometry approximation ensures that solutions generated retain second-order spatial accuracy. Second-order temporal accuracy is achieved by virtue of a multidimensional unsplit time integration scheme. We detail our geometrically based solution method, in which material volume fluxes are computed systematically with a set of simple geometric tasks. We then interrogate the method by testing its ability to track interfaces through large, controlled topology changes, whereby an initially simple interface configuration is subjected to vortical flows. Numerical results for these strenuous test problems provide evidence for the algorithm's improved solution quality and accuracy.},

The discontinuity-capturing directional dissipation (DCDD) was first introduced as a complement to the \{SUPG\} and \{PSPG\} stabilizations for the computation of incompressible flows in the presence of sharp solution gradients. The \{DCDD\} stabilization takes effect where there is a sharp gradient in the velocity field and introduces dissipation in the direction of that gradient. The length scale used in defining the \{DCDD\} stabilization is based on the solution gradient. Here we describe how the \{DCDD\} stabilization, in combination with the \{SUPG\} and \{PSPG\} stabilizations, can be applied to computation of turbulent flows. We examine the similarity between the \{DCDD\} stabilization and a purely dissipative energy cascade model. To evaluate the performance of the \{DCDD\} stabilization, we compute as test problem a plane channel flow at friction Reynolds number Reτ&#xa0;=&#xa0;180. },

The free surface wall contact point is investigated and a number of approximations to overcome the contradiction of a moving contact point and the wall no-slip condition are presented. The numerical procedure which utilizes these approximations is tested against a linear, analytical method which predicts viscous diffusion in the vicinity of the containing walls for a freely sloshing fluid. It is found that the numerical results using the various formulated boundary conditions converge as the Reynolds number increases. },

Convergence behavior is examined. Slot-coating results reveal slow-flow zones and show that at high capillary number and low metering rate the downstream meniscus can no longer attach to the slot.

Discontinuities inside elements, as they e.g. occur in two-phase/free-surface flows with implicit interface descriptions, can thereby be accounted for appropriately. Yet, the \{XFEM\} is often prone to ill-conditioning of the global system matrix which reduces the performance of iterative solution techniques significantly. This paper introduces and studies new approaches to circumvent the problem of ill-conditioning with the XFEM. The stable XFEM, a recently proposed approach, is employed and studied in this work. Approximation properties and iterative solver performance are systematically compared for the different approaches which should improve the conditioning. Two recommended settings are finally used to solve a 3D free-surface flow benchmark problem and a classical two-phase flow problem. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the stable \{XFEM\} is applied to industrially relevant flow problems. },

This paper investigates different enrichment schemes and time-integration schemes within the XFEM.

This method conserves the mass to machine error, performs better than split Eulerian and Lagrangian algorithms, and it is only slightly worse than unsplit schemes.

The standard level set method can capture the interface smoothly and gives accurate normal vectors but suffers from an excessive amount of mass gain/loss. The conservative level set method exhibits excellent mass conservation properties but the results are usually contaminated by inaccurate interface normal vectors. To address this problem, an improved conservative level set method is proposed to capture the interface smoothly with excellent mass conservation properties. The improvement of the method lies in that the surface normal is computed from a signed distance function which is also advected and re-initialized in the flow fields instead of using the Heaviside function. The proposed method is implemented by an implicit two-step Taylor–Galerkin approximation together with the fractional step algorithm within the finite element context. The approach is validated with well-known benchmark problems, including the long term advection of a circle, rotation of a slotted disk, stretching of a circular, dam-break flow and the Rayleigh–Taylor instability problem. The results from the proposed method show good agreement with existing experimental and numerical published results and are found to be highly reliable and accurate. "

To preserve the conservative property, the mapping given by ξ ̲ = x ̲ - u ̲ t is performed between two coordinates x ̲ and ξ ̲ for the advection–diffusion equation in a flow field with velocity u. To capture the interface, the flux term capable of compressing the level set contours is also adopted in the construction of linear inviscid Burgers’ equation, which is indispensable in the level set method. To resolve the physically sharp interface without incurring contact discontinuity oscillations, a damping term which is nonlinear in terms of the level set function and can render an adequate artificial diffusion to stabilize the contact surface is added into the reinitialization step in the modified level set method. For accurately predicting the level set function, the advection scheme for solving the linear inviscid Burgers’ equation in the advection step of the modified level set method is developed to accommodate the true dispersion relation. The solution computed from the resulting two-dimensional dispersion-relation-preserving advection scheme can minimize the phase error. Less artificial damping is needed to damp the oscillations in the vicinity of contact surface and the interface can be less numerically smeared. For the sake of programming simplicity, the incompressible two-phase flow will be discretized in non-staggered grids without incurring checkerboard oscillations by the developed explicit compact scheme for the approximation of pressure gradient terms. For the verification of the proposed two-dimensional dispersion-relation-preserving scheme and the non-staggered incompressible flow solver, three benchmark problems have been chosen in this study. The proposed conservative level set method for capturing the interface in incompressible fluid flows is also verified by solving the dam-break, bubble rising in water, droplet falling in water and Rayleigh–Taylor instability problems. Good agreements with the referenced solutions are demonstrated for all the four investigated problems. },

  Abstract                 = {Successful interface methods for multiphase flows need to be designed to operate well in the opposite extremes of strongly surface tension-dominant flows on the one hand and strongly deforming flows on the other. To this end, recent advances in direct numerical simulation of multiphase flows have involved the hybridization of popular methods. One hybrid approach developed by the authors is the level contour reconstruction method (LCRM), which combines the characteristics of both the front tracking and the level set method. It was designed specifically for general 3D multiphase flow problems where very dynamic and deformable interfaces interact and where accuracy, reliability, and simplicity are essential features. In this paper, we carry the hybridization of the LCRM with the level set technique to a further level in that the explicit calculation of a distance function is introduced and plays a crucial role in the interface reconstruction procedure as well as in the calculation of the surface tension force. An accurate method of computing the distance function directly from the tracked interface is presented whereby a vector distance function is found, i.e. the minimum distance to the interface as well as the corresponding minimum distance point location on the interface itself. This information allows us to calculate a compact curvature field for the computation of the surface tension force, which decreases the level of parasitic currents to a negligible level. Various benchmark test cases to demonstrate the accuracy of the new schemes compared with other existing methods are provided. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Two methods of sharpening contact discontinuities—the subcell resolution idea of Harten and the artificial compression idea of Yang, which those authors originally used in the cell average framework—are applied to the current \{ENO\} schemes using numerical fluxes and \{TVD\} Runge-Kutta time discretizations. The implementation for nonlinear systems and multi-dimensions is given. Finally, many numerical examples, including a compressible shock turbulence interaction flow calculation, are presented. },

This problem is typically handled by surface smoothing techniques, such as Laplacian filters, that eliminate high-frequency undulations but degrade the volume encompassed by the surface. The need for conserving volume (or mass) rules out the use of such techniques in several application, as for example incompressible flows. In this work we present a smoothing technique that suppresses undulations while conserving local volumes, ensuring that the global mass is conserved. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is illustrated in synthetic datasets as well as in free surface flows simulation.

Phys. 1994; 114: 146–159) that determines the distance function from an interface known as the zero level-set. The principal goal of sub-cell-fix method is to compute the distance function of the cells adjacent to the zero level-set without disturbing the original zero level-set. Following the original work of Russo and Smereka, several improved sub-cell-fix schemes were reported in the literature. In this paper, we show that in certain situations almost all the previous sub-cell-fix schemes can disturb the zero level-set, and the accuracy would not improve when the CFL numbers are decreased. Based on the scheme of Hartmann et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 2008; 227:6821–6845), we propose an improved sub-cell-fix scheme that can significantly increase the accuracy of sub-cell-fix method on problems that are challenging. The scheme makes use of a combination of the points adjacent to zero level-set surfaces and preserves the interface in a second-order accuracy. The new sub-cell-fix scheme is capable of handling large local curvature, and as a result it demonstrates satisfactory performance on several challenging test cases. Limitations of the schemes on highly stretched grids are illustrated. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Phase boundaries are considered sharp and their motion is computed using the coupled level set/volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) method. General geometries are represented using a “Cartesian grid” approach; not a body-fitted approach. Our algorithm is designed to be “robust”; in other words we compute flows in which phase boundaries and geometry boundaries can be very complex with very little user intervention. In this paper we study the speed-up gained via adaptive mesh refinement, and/or parallelization. },

The liquid is assumed incompressible and the vapor is assumed to have constant pressure in space. Second order algorithms are used for finding “mass conserving” extension velocities, for discretizing the local interfacial curvature and also for the discretization of the cell-centered projection step. Convergence studies are given that demonstrate this second order accuracy. Examples are provided that apply to cavitating bubbles. },

In the level set approach, the free surface is represented as the zero level set of a smooth function; this has the effect of replacing the advection of density, which has steep gradients at the free surface, with the advection of the level set function, which is smooth. In addition, the free surface can merge or break up with no special treatment. We maintain the level set function as the signed distance from the free surface in order to accurately compute flows with high density ratios and stiff surface tension effects. In this work, we couple the level set scheme to an adaptive projection method for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, in order to achieve higher resolution of the free surface with a minimum of additional expense. We present two-dimensional axisymmetric and fully three-dimensional results of air bubble and water drop computations. },

A level set method is used where the interface is the zero level set of a continuous function while the two fluids are solutions of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation. We examine the rise and distortion of an initially spherical bubble into cap bubbles and toroidal bubbles. Steady solutions for gas bubbles rising in a liquid are computed, with favourable comparisons to experimental data. We also study the inviscid limit and compare our results with a boundary integral method. The problems of an air bubble bursting at a free surface and a liquid drop hitting a free surface are also computed.},

It couples the level-set and volume-of-fluid techniques and retains their advantages while overcoming their weaknesses. It is stable and robust even for large density and viscosity ratios on the order of 1000 to 1. The numerical method is an extension of the second-order method presented by Sussman [M. Sussman, A second order coupled levelset and volume of fluid method for computing growth and collapse of vapor bubbles, Journal of Computational Physics 187 (2003) 110–136] in which the previous method treated the gas pressure as spatially constant and the present method treats the gas as a second incompressible fluid. The new method yields solutions in the zero gas density limit which are comparable in accuracy to the method in which the gas pressure was treated as spatially constant. This improvement in accuracy allows one to compute accurate solutions on relatively coarse grids, thereby providing a speed-up over continuum or “ghost-fluid” methods.},

abstract = "This work encompasses numerical and experimental studies of three-dimensional (3D) sloshing problems. The two-fluid viscous flow, which is solved within a stabilized finite element context, involves liquid and gaseous phases. The free surface is captured with a level set (LS) method, including the bounded renormalization with continuous penalization technique, to avoid the well-known spreading of the marker function. Specifically, this technique is improved with a volume-preserving algorithm for long-term analyses. To verify the numerical model, the responses of free-sloshing cases are compared with analytical solutions and other results computed using a Lagrangian technique. These simulations assess the influence of considering two-dimensional (2D) and 3D analyses, as well as the effects of depth and viscosity. This work presents data obtained from a forced sloshing experiment that is specifically devoted to 3D free surface behaviour. Free surface evolution measurements are used to validate the numerical method. Moreover, the effect of the initial conditions used to promote 3D behaviour in the modelling is evaluated."

abstract = {In its 3rd revised and extended edition the book offers an overview of the techniques used to solve problems in fluid mechanics on computers and describes in detail those most often used in practice. Included are advanced methods in computational fluid dynamics, like direct and large-eddy simulation of turbulence, multigrid methods, parallel computing, moving grids, structured, block-structured and unstructured boundary-fitted grids, free surface flows. The 3rd edition contains a new section dealing with grid quality and an extended description of discretization methods. The book shows common roots and basic principles for many different methods. The book also contains a great deal of practical advice for code developers and users, it is designed to be equally useful to beginners and experts. The issues of numerical accuracy, estimation and reduction of numerical errors are dealt with in detail, with many examples. A full-feature user-friendly demo-version of a commercial CFD software has been added, which can be used to compute all flow examples from the book. All computer codes can be accessed from the publishers server on the internet.},
