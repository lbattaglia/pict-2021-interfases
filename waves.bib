	abstract = {The performance of the open source multiphase flow solver, interFoam, is evaluated in this work. The solver is based on a modified volume of fluid (VoF) approach, which incorporates an interfacial compression flux term to mitigate the effects of numerical smearing of the interface. It forms a part of the C++ libraries and utilities of OpenFOAM and is gaining popularity in the multiphase flow research community. However, to the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of this solver is confined to the validation tests of specific interest to the users of the code and the extent of its applicability to a wide range of multiphase flow situations remains to be explored. In this work, we have performed a thorough investigation of the solver performance using a variety of verification and validation test cases, which include (i) verification tests for pure advection (kinematics), (ii) dynamics in the high Weber number limit and (iii) dynamics of surface tension-dominated flows. With respect to (i), the kinematics tests show that the performance of interFoam is generally comparable with the recent algebraic VoF algorithms; however, it is noticeably worse than the geometric reconstruction schemes. For (ii), the simulations of inertia-dominated flows with large density ratios ∼O(10 3 ) yielded excellent agreement with analytical and experimental results. In regime (iii), where surface tension is important, consistency of pressure–surface tension formulation and accuracy of curvature are important, as established by Francois et al (2006 J. Comput. Phys. 213 141–73). Several verification tests were performed along these lines and the main findings are: (a) the algorithm of interFoam ensures a consistent formulation of pressure and surface tension; (b) the curvatures computed by the solver converge to a value slightly (10\%) different from the analytical value and a scope for improvement exists in this respect. To reduce the disruptive effects of spurious currents, we followed the analysis of Galusinski and Vigneaux (2008 J. Comput. Phys. 227 6140–64) and arrived at the following criterion for stable capillary p simulations for interFoam: 1t 6 max(10τ μ , 0.1τ ρ ) where τ μ = μ1x/σ, and τ ρ = ρ1x 3 /σ . Finally, some capillary flows relevant to atomization were simulated, resulting in good agreement with the results from the literature.},

This paper reviews the different aspects of SSI for different types of foundations used or proposed to support offshore wind turbines. Due to cyclic and dynamic nature of the loading that acts on the wind turbine structure, the dominant SSI will depend to a large extent on the global modes of vibration of the overall structure. This paper summarises the modes of vibration of offshore wind turbines structures supported on different types of foundations based on observations from scaled model tests and numerical analysis. As these are new structures with limited monitoring data, field records are scarce. Field records available in the public domain are also used to compare with the experimental findings.},

	title = {Modelling of {Marine} {Renewable} {Energy}},
	abstract = {The development of marine renewable energy is attracting increasing attention due to its great potential in meeting human energy demands with limited negative environment impact. Various wave energy converter concepts have been proposed in attempt to convert wave energy into usable energy. Both experimental and numerical methods have been widely used to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of these devices in operational conditions and their survival characteristics in extreme sea states. This study focuses on developing a numerical procedure that can predict wave loads and run-up on fixed and moving offshore and coastal structures more accurately. The wave induced motions of flap-type wave energy converter (WEC) and its efficiencies are also investigated. The ultimate objectives of the study are to develop a rigorous approach for the safe and cost efficient design of general offshore structures and leading to the better design of wave energy converters with increased efficiency, and provide best practice guideline to the wave energy converter developers and researchers and engineers in the field. Non-linear hydrodynamic modelling in viscous flow has been used in the simulations. Even for moderate waves, nonlinear effects are important due to wave-structure interaction and also the expected large motions under operational conditions. It seems likely that estimates of performance will be unreliable unless the nonlinear effects associated with such large amplitude motions are properly accounted for. Extreme conditions are also be analysed to ensure device integrity. OpenFOAM, a free, open-source CFD package, has been applied in this work due to its strong capability in coastal and offshore engineering. The built-in viscous solvers interFoam and interDyMFoam have been selected and extended to model wave interactions with fixed and moving offshore and coastal structures, respectively. The solvers have been firstly extended to generate various wave conditions, including regular waves, focused wave groups and tsunami waves etc. New module has also been developed to advance the wave absorption capability in attempt to reduce computational cost of the numerical model by using smaller computational domain. In order to simulate the motion of WECs in waves, the code has been further developed to have functions on determining the wave-induced motions of WECs and on updating the computational domain automatically according to the motion of the WEC. By comparing with published experimental data, theoretical and numerical results on various physical problems, including wave interactions with varied seabed, a fixed vertical circular cylinder, a rotating half-submerged rectangular barge and a flap-type wave energy converter etc. it is confident to say that OpenFOAM is very capable of modelling nonlinear wave interactions with coastal and offshore structures accurately.},

	abstract = {Wave breaking is mainly a three-dimensional flow problem characterized by wave energy dissipation due to turbulence. The understanding of the wave breaking mechanism on a beach is essential in studying coastal processes. The complexity of the wave-induced turbulence flow is also increased by the presence of a two-phase flow, which introduces buoyancy effects. In this work a set of numerical experiments is carried out on wave breaking on a gravel slope. The influence of a one-phase and two-phase flow and the permeability effect of the beach are investigated numerically by means of a Navier–Stokes model known as IH-3VOF, which considers the volume-averaged Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (VARANS) equations (del Jesus, 2011 [3]) to characterize the flow within the porous media. The accuracy of the VARANS equations is demonstrated by means of comparisons with laboratory data. The results are found to be within a 2\% error in terms of wave height prior to the broken wave, and up to a 10\% error after then, and in the order of 0.20 s in the time domain for the worst case. A further analysis of wave evolution on a permeable beach with alongshore variation of porosity is studied. Three-dimensional wave breaking and post-breaking wave transformations alongshore are analysed according to porosity values.},

	abstract = {This paper describes numerical and laboratory investigations that have been carried out to gain a better understanding of the physical processes involved in offshore breaking wave impacts on a large offshore structure. The findings are relevant to offshore and coastal structures and to identifying the extreme loads, peak pressures and maximum run-up needed for their design. A truncated wall in a wave flume is used to represent a vertical section of an FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) hull, which is a typical large offshore structure. Four types of wave impact were identified in the tests, and are referred to as slightly-breaking, flip-through, large air pocket and broken wave impacts. Physical modelling was undertaken in Plymouth University’s COAST Laboratory and the open source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package-Open Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) was adopted to study focused wave generation and wave impact on the hull. The method solves incompressible Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes Equations (URANSE) using a finite volume method with two phase flows. A Volume of Fluid (VoF) interface capturing approach is used to model the free surface. A NewWave boundary condition is used to generate focused wave groups based on the first plus second-order (hereafter second-order) Stokes wave theory in the Numerical Wave Tank (NWT). By changing the focus location with respect to the wall, the wave impact type was altered in both the numerical and laboratory investigations. The results show that for the four wave impact types tested good agreement was achieved between numerical predictions and experimental measurements of surface elevation, run up and impact force. The peak pressures predicted by the simulation are lower than the experimentally measured results due to time step constraints, although the shape of the pressure time history is very similar. Four distinct wave impact types are identified for the vertical hull section and are found to be similar in character to those observed for a full depth vertical wall. The predicted force on the hull is found to be greatest for the large air pocket impact, and the highest run-up for the slightly-breaking wave impact. The pressure records show a high degree of spatial and temporal variation though the highest pressure recorded at any location was due to flip-through. This research has shown that different characteristic wave impact types are responsible for maximum load and greatest wave run-up and so need to be considered separately for design purposes.},

Das Verfahren dient als Grundlage für die Entwicklung/Verifizierung theoretischer Beschreibungen der für die Belastung relevanten Prozesse. Das Verfahren wird in den Kapiteln 4-7 beschrieben und implementiert. Als Hauptgrundlage der Arbeit dienen großmaßstäbliche Versuche - KC= 3 bis 14, Re= 4.0E5 bis 1.2E6 - im Großen Wellenkanal (Kapitel 3). Zur Klassifikation nach Lastfällen werden (i) die Distanz des Brechpunkts zur Zylinderfront und (ii) der Brechertyp mittels einer neu implementierten Methode berücksichtigt. Dabei werden gebrochene und brechende Wellen, steile Wellen und flache Wellen unterschieden. Für die Krafttrennung in quasi-statischen und dynamischen Kraftanteil wurde ein neues robustes Verfahren erfolgreich eingesetzt (Kapitel 4). Als weiterer Schlüsselbeitrag folgt die Analyse des dynamischen Kraftanteils (Kapitel 5). Die von Wienke \& Oumeraci (2005) ermittelten curling Faktoren wurden für wassertiefenbedingte Sturzbrecher bestätigt. Bei Kollapsbrechern ist eine Anpassung aufgrund einer steileren Wellenfront erforderlich. Die Analyse des quasi-statische Kraftanteils erfolgt in den Kapiteln 6 \& 7. Zunächst wird die gängige Praxis bei der Anwendung der Morison-Formel kritisch im Hinblick auf sehr steile Wellen diskutiert. Anschließend werden in Kapitel 7 die Kraftkoeffizienten CM und CD anhand der gemessenen Orbitalströmung und Linienkräfte auf das Bauwerk ermittelt. Es zeigt sich, dass Werte aus den Regelwerken korrigiert werden sollten. Außerdem werden potentialtheoretische Erweiterungen der Morison-Formel getestet. Abschließend konnten nicht lineare Effekte wie das sog. „ringing“ sehr gut anhand der gemessenen Wasserspiegelauslenkung ermittelt werden.},

	url = {https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/426457/},
	abstract = {Wave breaking is one of the most violent phenomena of air-water interface interactions, producing strong turbulence with air bubbles, water droplets, jets and sprays. These phenomena commonly occur in ship flows and are one of the main sources of underwater noise and white-water wakes. The investigation of these phenomena is important in ship and ocean engineering. OpenFOAM is a valuable open source and continuum mechanics library for building multi-physics simulations and its use is growing rapidly in both research and industry. This paper investigates the ability of OpenFOAM to simulate non-linear waves, wave transformation and breaking with k-omega SST-RANS model through the study of wave generation and propagation over a submerged bar. In the first instance an empty numerical wave flume is constructed. In earlier versions of OpenFoam, water wave modelling was developed by various software packages, such as olaFoam, waves2Foam and IHFoam. Among them, waves2Foam, developed by Jacobsen et al. (2012), is probably the most common toolkit used in ship-wave interaction simulations. However, these packages are no longer supported in the newest standard release of OpenFOAM 5.0.0 (OF500), due to installation, maintenance and coding standard problems. A new framework of waveModel is instead supported for wave generation. In this study, the waves2Foam implemented in OpenFOAM 3.0.1 (OF301) and waveModel in OF500 are employed and compared to examine their abilities and stability in modelling of regular wave propagation.Based on the numerical wave flume, the waves2Foam model is used to simulate both non-breaking and breaking waves. The numerical results are compared with the experimental measurements by Beji and Battjes (1993). Several previous studies of breaking waves using waves2Foam have only performed numerical calculations for breaking waves on a beach profile (Jacobsen et al., 2012; Jacobsen et al.,2014; Zhou et al., 2017). The effect of obstacles on wave propagation was modelled by Gadelho et al. (2014), but they only reported non-breaking wave transformations. In the current study, non-breaking and spilling breaking waves generated by Stokes waves of different incident wave heights are investigated with waves2Foam. Finally, the study is extended to investigate the effects of convection schemes on the multiphase simulations. Four different schemes are tested for their ability to predict regular wave propagation as well as wave transformation and breaking over the bar.},

	abstract = {The performance of interFoam (a widely-used solver within the popular open source CFD package OpenFOAM) in simulating the propagation of a nonlinear (stream function solution) regular wave is investigated in this work, with the aim of systematically documenting its accuracy. It is demonstrated that over time there is a tendency for surface elevations to increase, wiggles to appear in the free surface, and crest velocities to become (severely) over estimated. It is shown that increasing the temporal and spatial resolution can mitigate these undesirable effects, but that a relatively small Courant number is required. It is further demonstrated that the choice of discretization schemes and solver settings (often treated as a ”black box” by users) can have a major impact on the results. This impact is documented, and it is shown that obtaining a ”diffusive balance” is crucial to accurately propagate a surface wave over long distances without requiring exceedingly high temporal and spatial resolutions. Finally, the new code isoAdvector is compared to interFoam, which is demonstrated to produce comparably accurate results, while maintaining a sharper surface. It is hoped that the systematic documentation of the performance of the interFoam solver will enable its more accurate and optimal use, as well as increase awareness of potential shortcomings, by CFD researchers interested in the general CFD simulation of free surface waves.},

	abstract = {The simulation tool COMFLOW, developed for accurate predictions of hydro-dynamic wave loading, is based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The free-surface dynamics is described through VOF, with local height-function approach to enhance accuracy. Numerical reflections are prevented by specially designed absorbing boundary conditions. Gravity-consistent density averaging for two-phase flow prevents spurious velocities near the free surface. Good progress has been made in the prediction of sloshing, green water loading and wave run-up. In the COMFLOW3 project the focus is on wave propagation, the effect of viscosity in shear layers (regularisation turbulence modelling), interactive vessel-wave dynamics and improved numerical efficiency through local grid refinement.},

	volume = {2},
	doi = {https://doi.org/10.2118/950149-G},
	abstract = {The force exerted by unbroken surface waves on a cylindrical object, such as a pile, which extends from the bottom upward above the wave crest, is made upof two components, namely: 1. A drag force proportional to the square of the velocity which may be represented by a drag coefficient having substantially the same value as for steady flow, and 2. A virtual mass force proportional to the horizontal component of the accelerative force exerted on the mass of water displaced by the pile. These relationships follow directly from wave theory and have been confirmed by measurements in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley. The maximum force exerted by breakers or incipient breakers is impulsive in nature, reaching a value much greater than that produced by unbroken waves but enduring for only a short time interval. This impulsive force represents the ultimate development of the accelerative force and is produced by the steep wave front and large horizontal acceleration at the front of a breaker. This impulsive force greatly exceeds the drag force computed from the particle velocities of the breaker. The reader is cautioned that these preliminary results are applicable only to single piles without bracing and are likely to be modified somewhat where multiple piles are driven, one within the influence of the other or where multiple piles are connected by submerged bracing. This paper is essentially a preliminary report submitted at this time because of the current importance of wave forces in the design of offshore structures. An extended series of additional experiments is planned for the near future. Theoretical Relationships: for the sake of simplicity of treatment, the theory will be developed from the equations for waves of small amplitude. T.P.2846},

	abstract = {We devise a numerical method for passive advection of a surface, such as the interface between two incompressible fluids, across a computational mesh. The method is called isoAdvector, and is developed for general meshes consisting of arbitrary polyhedral cells. The algorithm is based on the volume of fluid (VOF) idea of calculating the volume of one of the fluids transported across the mesh faces during a time step. The novelty of the isoAdvector concept consists of two parts. First, we exploit an isosurface concept for modelling the interface inside cells in a geometric surface reconstruction step. Second, from the reconstructed surface, we model the motion of the face–interface intersection line for a general polygonal face to obtain the time evolution within a time step of the submerged face area. Integrating this submerged area over the time step leads to an accurate estimate for the total volume of fluid transported across the face. The method was tested on simple two-dimensional and three-dimensional interface advection problems on both structured and unstructured meshes. The results are very satisfactory in terms of volume conservation, boundedness, surface sharpness and efficiency. The isoAdvector method was implemented as an OpenFOAM® extension and is published as open source.},

	title = {Laboratory study investigating the three-dimensional turbulence and kinematic properties associated with a breaking solitary wave},
	abstract = {A laboratory experiment was performed to investigate the three-dimensional turbulence and kinematic properties that develop due to a breaking solitary and an irregular shallow water bathymetry. A large basin equipped with a piston-type wavemaker was used to generate the wave, while the free surface elevations and fluid velocities were measured using wave gauges and three-dimensional acoustic-Doppler velocimeters (ADVs), respectively. From the free surface elevations, the evolution and runup of the wave was revealed; while from the ADVs, the velocity and turbulent energy was determined to identify specific turbulent events and coherent structures. It was found that shoaling was confined to areas with gentler sloping bathymetry near the basin side walls and the runup shoreward of the still water shoreline was not uniform. The runup was characterized by a jetting mechanism caused by the convergence of water mass near the basin centerline as the wave refracted during breaking. The jetting mechanism caused the greatest cross-shore velocities to be located near the basin centerline. The greatest turbulent events were well correlated to borefronts, resembling hydraulic jumps, where the greatest shear and fluid accelerations occurred. Because of an abrupt change in the bathymetry, a coherent structure developed which was found to have a three-dimensional flow field. It was proposed that variations in the internal flow with depth were due to the orientation of multiple vortex rings.},

	abstract = {Hydrodynamic wave loading on and in offshore structures is studied by carrying out numerical simulations. Particular attention is paid to complex hydrodynamic phenomena such as wave breaking and air entrapment. The applied CFD method, ComFLOW, solves the Navier–Stokes equations with an improved Volume-of-Fluid method to track the movement of the free surface. A local height function keeps the surface sharp (no ‘flotsam and jetsam’). Application of two different fluid models, single-phase (only liquid) and two-phase (liquid and compressible gas) is presented, the latter model being capable of simulating bubbles of entrapped gas. Treatment of the density around the free surface is found highly critical for obtaining an accurate fluid distribution and velocity field. A newly-developed gravity-consistent density averaging method is applied to prevent spurious velocities around the free surface. The convective terms are approximated by a compressible, symmetry-preserving second-order upwind discretization. Time integration, using second-order Adams–Bashforth, is carried out with a generalization of the familiar pressure-correction method, in which the full acoustical part of the flow equations is treated implicitly. Numerical results are validated against experimental data for two test cases. As an example of internal wave loading, liquid sloshing dynamics are validated with experimental results for a 1:10 scale LNG tank section. In particular, the experimental pressure signal during a moment of air entrapment is compared with one-phase and two-phase flow simulations. The simulation of external wave loading is validated with data from an experiment with wave run-up against a 1:50 scale semi-submersible offshore structure. The test cases show that modeling of two-phase effects can be beneficial for simulating hydrodynamic wave loading.},

	abstract = {Sustainable and efficient design solutions are the aim for any engineer. In offshore engineering forces resulting from extreme wave impact are of special interest as these challenge the structure and the crew working in this harsh environment. Theoretical models tend to be limited to linear or weakly non-linear situations and are unable to predict the violent and turbulent effects of breaking waves in combination with wave run up on structures or green water loading. The classic approach for such cases is to carry out scale model tests in a physical wave tank and measure the forces, water levels and flow velocities at some chosen locations. Another approach is to use fully non-linear calculations, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, which have the potential to investigate the design in different conditions at full scale. This paper deals with the generation and behaviour of extreme focused wave groups in a numerical wave tank. Non-linear effects of these extreme waves are shown and the implications for a numerical wave tank are discussed. Also the forces on horizontal and vertical cylinders, which represent simple models of offshore structures, are calculated. All numerical results are compared with measured data from physical experiments.},

	abstract = {A fully non-linear numerical wave tank (NWT), based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), provides a useful tool for the analysis of coastal and offshore engineering problems. To generate and absorb free surface waves within a NWT, a variety of numerical wave maker (NWM) methodologies have been suggested in the literature. Therefore, when setting up a CFD-based NWT, the user is faced with the task of selecting the most appropriate NWM, which should be driven by a rigorous assessment of the available methods. To provide a consistent framework for the quantitative assessment of different NWMs, this paper presents a suite of metrics and methodologies, considering three key performance parameters: accuracy, computational requirements and available features. An illustrative example is presented to exemplify the proposed evaluation metrics, applied to the main NWMs available for the open source CFD software, OpenFOAM. The considered NWMs are found to reproduce waves with an accuracy comparable to real wave makers in physical wave tank experiments. However, the paper shows that significant differences are found between the various NWMs, and no single method performed best in all aspects of the assessment across the different test cases.},

	abstract = {In these experiments we report on the interaction of steep waves, both non-breaking and breaking, hitting a bottom-founded vertical circular cylinder. Both the scattered wave surface elevations around the column and the total horizontal forces were measured. In contrast to most previous experiments, we concentrate on hitting the column with localised wave groups not with regular or random waves. By repeating the tests with both focussed wave groups and the same wave groups inverted, so each tall crest in one is replaced by a deep trough in the inverted form, we are able to identify unambiguously the complete Stokes expansion type representation of the applied force: linear, second order two-frequency sum and difference, 3rd order triple-frequency sum, etc. The cumulative effect of this relatively small but significant high frequency excitation is to produce dynamic response or "ringing" of the column if the lowest resonant frequency is in the right range. Remarkably, much of this harmonic structure survives even with violently breaking waves. Offshore wind turbine farms are constructed in areas of high winds where large waves will also occur. Thus, wave induced loads are an important design constraint. In this work we concentrate on nonlinear components of the hydrodynamic loading on a surface piercing column as a model of the base of an offshore wind turbine. The loads which we identify are potential in form - drag forces appear to be negligible, consistent with a Keulegan-Carpenter parameter KC O(10) for the largest waves reported here. Most wave-structure interaction experiments are performed either with regular waves or in realisations of random sea-states. The first lacks any representation of the broadband spectrum of real ocean waves, the second suffers problems of wave reflections in finite sized tanks and also the rarity of extreme wave events of interest for design in a random sea-state. In contrast, we have performed a large set of focussed wave group tests, where both the frequency spectrum and phase of the components are carefully controlled. In these tests, the key feature is the use of wave groups. The aim of this is twofold: first to ensure that each short test contains an interaction of interest, and second to allow the unambiguous extraction of the harmonic structure of the fluid loading on a vertical column.},

	abstract = {Abstract Offshore wind turbines are subjected to multiple dynamic loads arising from the wind, waves, rotational frequency (1P) and blade passing frequency (3P) loads. In the literature, these loads are often represented using a frequency plot where the power spectral densities (PSDs) of wave height and wind turbulence are plotted against the corresponding frequency range. The PSD magnitudes are usually normalized to unity, probably because they have different units, and thus, the magnitudes are not directly comparable. In this paper, a generalized attempt has been made to evaluate the relative magnitudes of these four loadings by transforming them into bending moment spectra using site-specific and turbine-specific data. A formulation is proposed to construct bending moment spectra at the mudline, i.e. at the location where the highest fatigue damage is expected. Equally, this formulation can also be tailored to find the bending moment at any other critical cross section, e.g. the transition piece level. Finally, an example case study is considered to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. The constructed spectra serve as a basis for frequency-domain fatigue estimation methods available in the literature. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper presents a simplified way of carrying out the design of monopiles based on necessary data (i.e. the least amount of data), namely site characteristics (wind speed at reference height, wind turbulence intensity, water depth, wave height and wave period), turbine characteristics (rated power, rated wind speed, rotor diameter, cut-in and cut-out speed, mass of the rotor-nacelle-assembly) and ground profile (soil stiffness variation with depth and soil stiffness at one diameter depth). Other data that may be required for final detailed design are also discussed. A flowchart of the design process is also presented for visualisation of the rather complex multi-disciplinary analysis. Where possible, validation of the proposed method is carried out based on field data and references/guidance are also drawn from codes of practice and certification bodies. The calculation procedures that are required can be easily carried out either through a series of spreadsheets or simple hand calculations. An example problem emulating the design of foundations for London Array wind farm is taken to demonstrate the proposed calculation procedure. The data used for the calculations are obtained from publicly available sources and the example shows that the simplified method arrives at a similar foundation to the one actually used in the project.},

	abstract = {An open source CFD solver,OpenFOAM R , has been used to create a numerical wave tank. The study is based on the interFoam solver, i.e. a solver for incompressible multiphase flow problems. The solver uses the finite volume method for the spatial discretization of equations and applies the VOF approach for the free surface modeling. Initially a convergence study was carried out. The study was based on the propagation of fifth order Stokes waves in deep water condition. To this end two separate applications, waveWriter and errorCalculator, were created. With the former the initial conditions for the velocities and pressure of fifth order Stokes wave can been specified directly for interFoam. The errorCalculator is a post-processing tool that estimate the computational errors at each time step. The study revealed that the model exhibits only first order convergence. The loss of one order is due to the waveWriter setting only first order initial conditions. Wave generation and absorption in the wave tank are performed by the relaxation method. For this purpose the existing interFoam solver has been partially modified in order for replacing the computational solutions with desired analytical ones inside the relaxation zones. In this manner the modified solver is able to generate and dissipate different wave types in the numerical wave tank. It is shown that outgoing waves are absorbed efficiently by extending the damping relaxation zone to at least three wavelengths, while one wavelength extension is required for the wave-generating zone. To validate the numerical wave tank, the Whalin shoaling test was considered. Unfortunately, inadequacies in the then existing version of interFoam, (version 1.6.x), in the handling of the pressure force balance on non-orthogonal and distorted meshes, hindered and finally stopped the validation test process. Subsequently it was found that the newer version OpenFOAM-1.7.x, can be used promisingly for the validation of wave tank by Whalin test and this has been defined as a recommended future work.},

	title = {Numerical Modelling of Extreme Waves: the Role of Nonlinear Wave-Wave Interactions}, 
	abstract = {The real monsters of the ocean, extreme waves, haunted mariners since the early days of human activities in the sea. Despite having caused numerous accidents and casualties, their systematic study began only in 2000s. Many mechanisms have been proposed to simulate these rare but catastrophic events, with the most prominent being wave focusing. This is connected to the NewWave theory, which has been used extensively in experimental and numerical modelling. However, the majority of the studies fail to capture the distinguishing characteristics of extreme waves, due to the inherent high nonlinearity of the problem and shortcomings of the modelling practice, but also due to inadequate knowledge of the underlying physics. Overcoming these issues is unquestionably necessary for understanding extreme waves and including them in the engineering design practice. The nonlinearity of the problem lies upon the nonlinear wave-wave interactions, which violate the fundamental linear assumptions of NewWave and pose challenges to numerical models. The present work aims at contributing in both understanding the nature of nonlinear wave-wave interactions during the formation of extreme wave events, and examining the applicability and performance of numerical solvers via their systematic validation with state-of-the-art techniques that give new insights into the problem. A range of phase-resolving and phase-averaged models are employed to cover different scales and examine the undergoing physical processes. Through the study of limiting breaking unidirectional dispersive wave groups in finite water depth, it is demonstrated that the free-wave spectrum undergoes considerable transformation and a large portion of energy is transferred to higher and lower harmonics. These effects can be attributed to the action of near-resonant and bound nonlinearities, which have however robust mathematical description. As such, a large part of the thesis is devoted to analytical methods towards establishing an efficient integrated framework for estimating extreme wave profiles, going beyond the classic NewWave. Overall, the present work is a balance of physics and numerics to tackle parts of the challenging problem of extreme waves and improve safety at sea.},

	abstract = {First- and higher-harmonic wave loads on a vertical circular cylinder are investigated 
experimentally in a wave tank of small scale. The incoming waves are (periodic) Stokes 
waves with wave slope up to 0.24. A large set of waves which are long compared to the 
cylinder radius is calibrated. The first seven harmonic components of the measured 
horizontal force on the cylinder are analysed. The higher-harmonic forces are significantly 
smaller than the first-harmonic force for all wave parameters. The measurements 
are continued until the wave amplitude is comparable to the cylinder radius, 
where the second-, third- and fourth-harmonic forces become of comparable size. 
Comparison with existing perturbation and fully nonlinear models shows, with a few 
exceptions, an overall good agreement for small and moderate wave amplitude. A fully 
nonlinear model agrees with the experiments even up to the seventh-harmonic force for 
part of the amplitude range. For the large amplitudes the models mostly give conservative 
predictions. It is important that the distance from the wave maker to the cylinder 
is large in order to avoid parasitic effects in the incoming wave field. The limited 
width of the wave tank is not important to the results except when close to resonance.},

’The Wave Loads project’ (2010-2013) was a three-year research project with the purpose to
establish more accurate models for wave loads on offshore wind turbines. ’Wave loads’ was
carried out collaboratively by DTU Wind Energy, DTU Mechanical Engineering and DHI.
’Wave Loads’ was funded by the ForskEL programme under grant ForskEL-10495 by En-
erginet.dk. Additional funding was provided by Statkraft under the Statkraft Ocean Energy Re-
search Program, and from internal funding at DHI and DTU. The funding provided a fantastic
opportunity for the participants to advance the knowledge and tools for wave loads on offshore
wind turbines. The funding and cooperation of the funding bodies is gratefully acknowledged.
An advisory board with participation of Niels Jacob Tarp Johansen (DONG Energy), Erik Asp
Hansen (DNV KEMA), Jørgen Ranum Krokstad (Statkraft) and Erik Damgaard Christensen
(DTU Mechanical Engineering) was established. The advisory board met twice a year with
the project partners where the research results were discussed along with future directions for
the project. The Advisory board members are gratefully thanked for sharing their insight with
us. Further collaboration has taken place through mutual research visits with Statkraft and two
joint MSc projects with DONG. These collaborations are highly appreciated.

	abstract = {To support concept studies aimed at assessing offshore wind technology, we developed the specifications of a representative utility-scale multimegawatt turbine now known as the “NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine.” This wind turbine is a conventional three-bladed upwind variable-speed variable blade-pitch-to-feather-controlled turbine. To create the model, we obtained some broad design information from the published documents of turbine manufacturers, with a heavy emphasis on the REpower 5M machine. Because detailed data was unavailable, however, we also used the publicly available properties from the conceptual models in the WindPACT, RECOFF, and DOWEC projects. We then created a composite from these data, extracting the best available and most representative specifications. This report documents the specifications of the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine—including the aerodynamic, structural, and control-system properties—and the rationale behind its development. The model has been, and will likely continue to be, used as a reference by research teams throughout the world to standardize baseline offshore wind turbine specifications and to quantify the benefits of advanced land- and sea-based wind energy technologies.},

By combining measured force time histories for a steep wave group and that from the same wave group but inverted, the complete harmonic structure of the total hydrodynamic loading can be extracted. The 2 nd -5 th harmonic load components scale with the appropriate power of the envelope of the linear force component in both time variation and amplitude.

In this regard, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology has shown to be a reliable tool, in the case of breaking waves especially. In this paper, two CFD models are tested in the reproduction of the experimental spilling waves impacting a circular cylinder for four different wave impact scenarios for focused waves. The numerical and experimental free surface elevations at different locations around the cylinder are also compared to verify the both numerical models. The numerical results from the models are shown together with the experimental measurements. Both CFD models are able to model the impact forces with a reasonable accuracy. When the cylinder is placed at a distance of 0.7 m from the wave breaking point, the value of the measured wave impact forces is highest due to the overturning wave crest and air entrainment. The wave-induced impact forces decrease, when the monopile is placed at distances further away from the breaking location.},

	abstract = {Active wave absorption in a physical wave flume or basin requires a wavemaker, a hydrodynamic feedback, and an absorption control system. The feedback provides the information on the waves to be absorbed, and the control system ensures that the paddle of a wavemaker moves accordingly. Different ways of viewing the principle of active absorption are discussed, and basic concepts are examined for the simple case of shallow water waves, starting with the flume case and subsequently including wave obliqueness. A brief review is given of existing 2D systems for active absorption in wave flumes. Quasi-3D systems for multidirectional waves constituted by an array of independent flume systems are discussed, and fully 3D systems, including a coupling between neighboring feedback signals, are reviewed. The diverse appearance of these systems is mainly due to different ideas of accounting for wave obliqueness. An attempt is made to unify the different approaches using the notion of a 2D filter giving the relation between the paddle control and the feedback, regarding each of the two signals as one function of time and space (along the wavemaker), instead of as an array of 1D functions of time. So far, active absorption relies on linear systems. Suggestions are made for the direction of future research, including the prospects for nonlinear extensions.},

	abstract = {This method for calculating the force of ocean waves on offshore drilling structures utilizes a mathematical model for the flow field of highly nonlinear waves; the method is considered applicable to a broad range of wave conditions commonly encountered in offshore design.An extensive body of knowledge is developing in the area of ocean wave forces on cylinders. Excellent summaries appear in Refs. 1 and 2; important contributions of mathematical models used in wave-force calculations are described in Refs. 3 through 5; and wave-force measurement installations are described in Refs. 6 and 7. From theoretical and experimental work has come a variety of wave-force calculation methods for use in engineering; one such example is presented in Ref. 8. Most published methods are presented in Ref. 8. Most published methods are based on the analysis of relatively few waves of low to moderate height and mathematical models that involve major simplifications in the representation of real ocean waves. There has been a need, therefore, to improve the mathematical model and to use information from larger waves. A mathematical model was developed and proved to be a substantial improvement over the available models. Using this model and data from large-amplitude waves measured in the Gulf of Mexico, Standard Oil Co. of California developed the method reported here for use in design of offshore structures.The mathematical model used in the wave-force calculation method was picked to be compatible with specification of design wave conditions in terms of a single wave; the calculated forces are used in a space-frame loading program to calculate the loads on a complete structure. Although this deterministic, single-wave approach appears to conflict with the fact that the sea is non-deterministic and can be described only statistically, for the following reasons the deterministic approach was chosen.Natural periods of structures considered when the method was developed were much shorter than the period range of significant wave energy; hence, wave loads could be treated as static loads.Nonlinear wave theories could be used for calculating the single wave, whereas time series representations used in the statistical models were not developed to the point that nonlinear wave characteristics could be modeled.Statistical characteristics of a sea that are of importance to the static load case could be approximated in selection of design wave heights and calculation of wave forces.Considerable progress is being made on calculation methods using time-series description of waves and forces, and such methods will be used when longer period structures, requiring dynamic analysis, are studied.JPTP. 368},

	abstract = {Many offshore and harbour structures may be considered as slender cylindrical structures or are composed of cylindrical slender members. Wave forces on such slender structures are usually calculated by the Morison equation. In this paper, the special case of breaking waves acting on a slender cylindrical pile is examined. The wave load is splitted into a quasi-static and a dynamic (slamming) component. The quasi-static load is reasonably approximated by the Morison equation, whereas the dynamic component is associated with the impact of a mass of water on the cylinder. The time history and the intensity of this impact force are analysed. The theoretical description is based on the 2D-model of Wagner (1932) [Wagner, H., 1932. Über Stoß- und Gleitvorgänge an der Oberfläche von Flüssigkeiten. Zeitschrift für angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik 12 (4), 193–215 (in German)] for the peak pressure, which is extended to account for the total duration of the impact and for the 3D-case. As a result, an analytical description for the impact force is developed. Based on large-scale experiments the theoretical 2D-model is verified through comparison with measured local pressures on the tested cylinder. The theoretical 3D-model is verified through comparison with the total force, which is determined by the measured reaction forces at the bearings. As a result of this comparison, the curling factor, which is included in the theoretical model, is determined. The experimental investigations are restricted to plunging breakers. A classification of the breaker types, and thus of the loading cases, is suggested which is related to the distance between breaking location and cylinder. The dependency of the impact force on the yaw angle of the cylinder in and against wave direction is determined in five test series.},

The experimental results showed that the focused wave parameters, including wave steepness, frequency bandwidth, and directional spreading index, had significant impacts on the wave run-up on a cylinder. More specifically, the focused wave run-up increased as these parameters increased, and the maximum value of the measured wave run-up ratio could be as high as 1.68. The variations of the multi-directional focused wave run-up around the cylinder were also analyzed. The wave run-up at the front of the cylinder was greater than that at the other positions around the cylinder. The wave run-up reached the lowest values at 135°. The associated focused wave parameters also impacted the wave run-up distribution around the cylinder.},

The air content in water as well as the distance of the breaker from the wall is varied. A detailed description of the wave impact dynamics is given and the oscillation of the entrapped air-pocket is successfully computed. A comparison with experimental results shows however that the damping of these oscillations is underestimated, particularly for a low air-content. This might be due to the fact that the model does not allow for the air-pocket fragmentation. The pressure on the wall is thoroughly investigated. Two regions are distinguished: the first around the location of the maximum pressures where the pressure fluctuations are dominated by the air-pocket oscillations, and the second where the pressure fluctuations are related to steady transverse acoustic waves. Forces and moments induced by the impact are investigated and proved to be in agreement with experimental results. The influence of the oscillations of the entrapped air-pocket is found to be dominant in the dynamics of efforts on the wall, even though the steady acoustic modes play a significant role for a large air-content.},

In this study, physical experiments of the different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a vertical cylinder are implemented in a wave flume. The concept of decomposing the measured forces into quasi-static forces and dynamic forces is adopted. The method proposed by Irschik et al. (2004) using an FFT filter and EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) is applied in the decomposition process. Then a new method with a continuous wavelet-based filter is used that produces a more reasonable result. Subsequently, the results of the measured forces, the quasi-static forces, and the dynamic forces are analyzed by considering the different stages of the plunging breaker. The results show the peak forces induced by the various stages of the plunging breaker are quite different. Prior to the overturning jet impinging the free surface, the quasi-static forces due to the various stages of the plunging breaker are approximately the same, while the dynamic forces contribute to different strengths of the force oscillations and exhibit a similar response. Following the mixture of water with air, the peak value of the quasi-static force is no longer invariant but declines sharply.},

The PISO algorithm is utilized for the pressure-velocity coupling. The air-water interface is captured via Volume of Fluid (VOF) technique. The present numerical model is validated by simulating the solitary wave run-up and reflected against a vertical wall, and solitary wave run-up on a vertical circular cylinder. Comparisons between numerical results and available experimental data show satisfactory agreement. Furthermore, simulations are carried out to study the solitary wave run-up on the cylinder with different incident wave height H and different cylinder radius a. The relationships of the wave run-up height with the incident wave height H, cylinder radius a are analyzed. The evolutions of the scattering free surface and vortex shedding are also presented to give a better understanding of the process of nonlinear wave-cylinder interaction.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the performance of different turbulence models for predicting the interaction between breaking waves and a vertical cylinder based on the volume of fluid (VOF) method. Six different models are investigated in the present study, i.e., no turbulence model, the k−ω SST turbulence model, the buoyancy-modified k−ω SST turbulence model, the stabilized k−ω SST turbulence model, the modified stabilized k−ωSST turbulence model and the realizable k−ε turbulence model. The vertical cylinder is installed at the edge of a 1:10 slope on the bottom of the numerical wave tank. The numerical simulations are conducted by solving the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations using waves2Foam (a solver based on the open-source Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software OpenFOAM). The present numerical results of the surface elevations and the breaking wave forces are compared with published experimental data. The kinetic characteristics beneath the free surface including averaged velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent kinematic viscosity are also investigated. It is observed that the stabilized k−ω SST turbulence (λ2=0.05, αβs=1.36) and the buoyancy-modified k−ωSST turbulence model (αβs=1.176) effectively reduce the turbulent kinetic energy before wave breaking, but the predicted breaking wave forces on the cylinder are smaller than that of the experimental data. The k−ω SST turbulence model shows good agreement with the experimental data in terms of the free surface elevation and the breaking wave force, but it over-predicts the turbulent kinetic energy. The realizable k−ε turbulence model does not give good predictions of both the free surface elevation and the breaking wave force as compared to the published experimental data.},

Numerical results of regular wave interaction with a vertically suspending cylinder are presented first for validation by comparison with the published data. A series of simulation experiments are carried out, and the forces and the moments exerted by the regular waves on a fixed suspending cylinder payload and a fixed suspending cuboid payload with different postures are presented. It can be concluded from the results that the rotating rectangular payload (cuboid and cylinder) suffers a drastically changed moment when it is initially vertically placed, and the projection area of payload vertical to the force affects the corresponding force. The simulation results also show how the forces and the moments change with different posture angles. With some certain posture, the suspending payload suffers minimum forces and moments. Parametric study for the cuboid payload is done in the case of normal incidence. The influence of the payload\&rsquo;s size and wave parameters on forces and moments are analyzed. All of the numerical simulation results and conclusions provide the fundamentals for further research and safe control of offshore lifting or lowering.},

	abstract = {This article presents an investigation on the best practice for modeling of water wave generation and wave-structure interaction using a widely spread two-phase flow solver with a specific interface compression technique in OpenFOAM® (OpenFOAM Foundation Ltd., London, United Kingdom). A series of numerical experiments were conducted to examine the effects of the employed schemes, mesh resolution, time step resolution, and compression coefficient. Both surface elevation and velocity profile were considered as the criteria for assessment of the quality of the generated waves. The numerical experiments showed that by using a blending scheme between the Crank-Nicolson and Euler scheme, relatively high quality waves were produced, where the spurious current at the interface region was effectively reduced. Meanwhile, it was also recommended to apply a compression coefficient Cα = 1, the Courant number limit Co = .1, and a mesh resolution of 18 cells per wave height. This set of parameters was used to validate the numerical model for two sets of cases for wave forces on half-immersed horizontal cylinders. The results in general agreed well with the experimental data, although the inline forces were slightly but consistently overestimated.In the past few decades, because of the increase in the computing ability and resources, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach has been gaining popularity in the naval hydrodynamic communities. Considering that a large portion of naval hydrodynamic problems are concerned with the free-surface flows, e.g., ocean waves and its interaction with structures, a free-surface model is needed to couple with the Navier-Stokes solver. Eventually, as a result of direct application of the first principles, the solver can model both inertia and viscous dominant flows. Even local wave breaking and violent flows can be properly resolved.Different methods have been proposed to track the interface of free-surface flows. This includes height function method and line segment method, which are the simplest techniques to represent and configure a free surface. However, they have deficiencies when two surfaces intersect or when a surface folds over on itself, which are overcome by the marker and cell method proposed in Harlow and Welch (1965). In their method, massless particles are used to track the free surface in a Lagrangian manner. Alternatively, the level-set (LS) method or volume of fluid (VOF) method can be used to implicitly capture the surface in an Eulerian way. The LS method was introduced in Osher (1988) where the interface is defined as the one on which a level-set function is equal to zero. This LS function is continuous across the interface. Therefore, it is not significantly influenced by the numerical diffusion. However, the originally proposed LS method suffers from mass conservation problems, which has been resolved in, e.g., Olsson and Kreiss (2005) and Olsson et al. (2007).},

	abstract = {An analytical stream function expression representing a nonlinear gravity water wave is applied both to the representation of measured wave forms and also to nonlinear theoretical waves. The stream function form is chosen so that it is a solution to the Laplace equation and the bottom boundary condition; the parameters in the stream function expression are chosen by a numerical perturbation procedure that provides a best fit to the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions. The boundary condition errors associated with the nonlinear stream function representation of four measured wave profiles are compared with estimates of the corresponding errors associated with a linear representation. The stream function method is judged more accurate than a linear method if the wave height is greater than 50\% of the breaking height. The stream function method is also applied to represent theoretical waves for which only the wave height and period are available to characterize the wave profile. It is demonstrated that the method represents an improvement over other available nonlinear procedures. The method can be employed to represent wave conditions which include a prescribed uniform steady current and a specified pressure distribution on the free surface.},

	abstract = {Nowadays numerical simulation of soil structure interaction (SSI) is applied to different problems, such as the construction of reliable earthquake-resistant structures. To analyze SSI considering unbounded domains, a numerical implementation of a coupled finite element method (FEM) and scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) approach is used. The FEM discretizes the structures and its surrounding soil (near-field) while the infinite half-space (far-field) is realized by the SBFEM. Both methods are coupled at the near-/ far-field interface, where nodal information is exchanged. Computation of far-field solution involves more effort than the near-field, therefore it is convenient to use a coarser mesh for the far-field than for the near-field. In this work, projection methods are used to exchange nodal information at the non-matching boundary meshes. Their implementations are validated first. Then, a coupled FEM-SBFEM scheme which uses these methods is evaluated in two test problems of the SSI framework. Accuracy and stability of the results are analyzed, as well as memory storage and calculation effort savings. Matching mesh results are considered as reference. The solution scheme is finally used to solve a problem which involves a passing train and buildings placed close to its path, attaining good results.},

Inlet boundary conditions are allowed to recreate either regular and focused wave conditions, while outlet conditions are established in order to avoid non physical reflections of surface waves on the artificial limits of the domain.

	abstract = {The accurate estimation of the loads exerted by water waves on the pile of an offshore wind turbine is relevant in the design and verification of such machines. A very well-known procedure to calculate these loads is using the Morison equation, which considers both the inertia and drag forces. The computation of these forces requires in turn the estimation of the inertia and drag coefficients which are obtained from experimental correlations. On the other hand, the use of computational fluid dynamics techniques allows to calculate the dynamic forces for a wider range of water wave conditions than the Morison equation, as long as appropriate tools are available to generate these water waves in a controlled fashion. In this work, the capabilities provided by OpenFOAM regarding wave generation and wave absorption are exploited to analyze the dynamic loads on a rigid vertical cylinder placed in a water channel by the impingement of regular waves in the first place, and then by a focused wave group. The validation of the simulation results is performed by comparison with the Morison equation estimations, when applicable, and with those obtained by other authors both numerically and experimentally.},
